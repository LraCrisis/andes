<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Building the Andes OLI Course</span></h1>
<br>
This document describes how to build the OLI Andes-based physics course
content from the Andes source code tree. Formally, what you are
building is called a<span style="font-style: italic;"> content package</span>.
The content package includes all resources needed for the content. This
content package is deployed onto an OLI server. Once deployed,
instructors or developers with the appropriate access may then create
course sections which are instances of this content package.<br>
<br>
<h2>Accessing OLI <br>
</h2>
You must obtain a CMU andrew account. The OLI folks must give your
account permission to access the OLI servers. <br>
<br>
OLI course development involves the following servers:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The CVS repository server: <span style="font-weight: bold;">oli-cvs.andrew.cmu.edu</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>The development server (ODIN):&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">odin.web.cmu.edu</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>The QA server: <span style="font-weight: bold;">oli-qa.andrew.cmu</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>The production server: <span style="font-weight: bold;">www.cmu.edu/oli/</span></li>
</ul>
The front page of ODIN links to some documentation on OLI development
processes. A course author can freely build, deploy and update a
private version of the content package on the development server and
then build test courses using that package. Moving the course to QA or
production is
done by OLI staff at the appropriate time.<br>
<br>
OLI requires all source for building a course to be stored in its own
CVS repository.&nbsp; The OLI-CVS host name is actually the same as
odin, the development server. The bulk of the source to go into this
repository are OLI problem pages and related problem files which are
generated automatically from the Andes
source tree. Other portions like the course introduction page must be
created or modifiedby hand.<br>
<h2>Checking out from OLI-CVS</h2>
The CVS module containing the OLI physics course source is named
"intro-physics-1.0".&nbsp; To check out the main branch use a command
like the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cvs -d
:ext:andersw@oli-cvs.andrew.cmu.edu:/oli/cvs/content/lrdc/intro_physics
co intro_physics-1.0<br>
<br>
replacing the "andersw" with the appropriate user id. This will create
a directory named intro_physics-1.0 containing the OLI source tree. I
usually do this within the "oli" subdirectory of the Andes working
directory.<br>
<br>
Note: the "1.0" at&nbsp; the end of the CVS project name is
meaningless, and is potentially misleading, since the 1.0 here never
changes as new editions of the course are developed. There is a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">different </span>version number that
identifies the OLI content package version. The real content package
version number is set inside the sources (see below).&nbsp; This
content package version number functions within OLI somewhat like an
edition number on a textbook: courses built on one version of the
content package get patched as that version of the content package is
updated, but such courses are never upgraded to use a different version
of the content. The content package version has usually been
incremented each semester though this is not strictly necessary.&nbsp;
It now stands at 1.8.<br>
<br>
<h2>OLI Source structure</h2>
The OLI source has two main subdirectories:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content - holds the course content<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organizations - holds&nbsp; the&nbsp; files
specifying possible organizations of the course<br>
<br>
It also contains a "tools" directory&nbsp; which&nbsp; we do&nbsp; not
modify.<br>
<br>
<h4>The content tree</h4>
<h5>package.xml</h5>
The root of the content tree contains the file package.xml which
describes the content package. The most important thing in this is the
version identifier. To create a new version the version number must be
changed by hand. <br>
<h5>standard subdirectories</h5>
Within the content tree, files are grouped by type into subdirectories
named for the MIME type of files they contain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x-oli-workbook_page&nbsp; -- OLI workbook pages<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x-pitt-lrdc-andes1-assignment -- xml problem
descriptor files (see below)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; webcontent -- any content files that can be served
without special handling by a web server: gifs, jpegs, wmvs, whatever.<br>
<br>
For andes-specific files, we use a subdirectory within a webcontent
folder:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; webcontent/andes -- andes-problem files. This
includes the prb files for the problems as well as gifs or jpegs used.<br>
<h5>unit and module structure</h5>
The content directory is structured into a subdirectory for one unit
which contains two module subdirectories within it which parallel the
original unit and module structure of the course. These are named<br>
&nbsp; content<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _u1_intro_physics<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _m01_mechanics<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; _m02_em<br>
<br>
The key point is that the mechanics-related files have to go into the
_m01_mechanics tree while the E&amp;M files have to go within the
_m02_em tree. Both are contained in one big "unit" which is essentially
the whole course.<br>
<br>
Note: The hierarchical structure with unit and module directories was
once required by the OLI system but is not required any longer. So this
sturcture could in principle be
simplified so as to include all problem files in one directory. But it
is a
nuisance to change structure once the CVS is set up. The existing
script assumes this directory structure. <br>
<br>
The _u1_intro_physics unit directory contains the course introduction
page, and also an instructor-only information page. One might expect
supporting webcontent for these pages to be contained within the
_u1_intro_physics directory. However, for obscure historical reasons,
supporting webcontent for these pages are contained ina webcontent
directory at the root of the course (within the content directory),
rather than within the _u1... subdirectory.<br>
<br>
<h4>The organizations tree</h4>
This contains one subdirectory for each organization that an instructor
may select when building a course from this content package. An
organization file defines a table of contents structure over the course
content, and may also customize the stakes or gating requirements. We
provide three:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default -- the default, full course<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; em -- the E&amp;M only course<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mechanics -- the mechanics only problems.<br>
<br>
The organizations are defined in an xml file using OLI's simple format,
in which it is only necessary to list the relevant modules (not each
individual problem).&nbsp; The simple organization files change very
rarely so are not automatically generated. The only change that could
be necessary would be to add a new problem set, in which case the
necessary changes should be obvious using the existing <br>
<br>
Organization files do contain a content package version number which
must match the version number in the content package. So, a change to
the version number must also be applied to each organization.xml file. <br>
<br>
The gating requirements defined for Sandy Katz's experiment require
using the advanced format organization files. This involves listing
each problem with its prerequisites. Assuming this will not be required
it is not described here. <br>
