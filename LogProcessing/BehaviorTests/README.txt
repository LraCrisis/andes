The code in this section is used to iterate over stored 
logfiles in order to calculate various behavior statistics from the logs.  

The results will be stored in an ODBC compliant database with the database
specs being stored in the output-function code.  

The Base/Logtools.cl file contains both support code for logfile manipulation and
code for the sorting and cleaning fo zippled logfiles.
