Brett,

Here's some updated scripts for debugging php at the cmd line. 

There are 4 other files in this tarball

1) cmdLineDebug.php - the actual script which allows you to pass php scripts 
parameters at the cmd line

2) mysql_stuff.php - an include file which does all of the database connection
code

3) debugPhprc an an example of what could be in a .debugPhprc (rc file used by
cmdLineDebug.php

4) RP.php - a small excerpt of ReviewProcess.php which includes and makes use
of cmdLineDebug.php 

The header of cmdLineDebug.php provides details on how to use it.
