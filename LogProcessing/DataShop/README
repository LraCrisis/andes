</condition>


*** OSU class, Fall 2011

The OSU data dataset has no experimental conditions.
Its sections match regexp '^asu_3u16472755e704e5fasul1_.*'

*** UW Platteville class, Spring 2012

The uwplatt dataset has sections that match regexp
   '^uwplatt_(2Y130|514219|6l1305|3n130) for instructor Andy Pawl and
   '^uwplatt_(8p1304|90476)' for instructor David Schaife.
These all should be marked as an experiment with one
experimental condition.  Maybe something like:

<condition>
   <name>random-help-experiment</name>
   <desc>Randomly choose help strategy.</desc>
</condition>
