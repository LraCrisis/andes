Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.June-8-2007

Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.June-27-2007

Diff between June 8 & June 27:
  Bug #1297
  Bug #1299

Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.July-9-2007

Diff between June 27 & July 9:
  fix to code-char
  typos in write-loop-rule2 WRITE-CHARGE-FORCE-BFIELD-MAG define-line-integral
           LENS-EQN-IMAGE-AT-INFINITY 
  add z-component given to problems where vectors specified component-wise  
  control plus-minus printed out differently

Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.July-14-2007

Diff between July 9 and 14:  
   didn't do complete check, but differences appear to be due only
   to changes to problem definitions (POT4* etc.)

Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.July-16-2007

Diff was too messy

temporarily undo changes to reweighting in (contextualize ...).
Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.July-18-2007

Diff between July 14 and July 18:
     change in Help/Entry-API by Anders (NIL -> NIL;VALUE)
     lots of other stuff ..

fix bug in testing for done-already:
Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.July-20-2007

Diff between July 14 and July 20:  
     none, after canonicalization

Use EntryTests to determine matches to student entries:
Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.July-23-2007

Fix bug:  use unify for equivalence of SystemEntry-prop
Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.July-24-2007
   
Diff between July 24 and July 14:
     after canonicalization, all diffences due to
     fix of the SytemEntry equivalence.

Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.August-13-2007
Winter2007-USNA-treacywintersgill.August-13-2007.can

Diff between July 24 and August 13:
     differences from additional use of random in determining slot,
     fix error with remove-nil-keywords, changing blank space around "=",
     remove superfluous time slots in various hints (in KB/vectors.cl)
     change to hash function used in defining derivatives.
     fix bug in SWITCHED-X-AND-Y-SUBSCRIPT (so it now applies)
     Student equations setting unused zero components of vector equation to zero no longer flagged as error.
     Other changes that are not necessarily good:
         WRONG-TRIG-FUNCTION instead of USED-MAGNITUDE-INSTEAD-OF-COMPONENT
         Suggestion to enter B field magnitude instead of z-component of velocity
         UNDIAGNOSED-EQN-ERROR instead of MISSING-NEGATION-ON-VECTOR-MAGNITUDE
         DEFAULT-SHOULD-BE-NON-ZERO instead of DEFAULT-SHOULD-BE-UNKNOWN
         Also, there seems to be a number of error interpretations that have been
         changed due to the changes in the use of the random number generator for tie-breaking.
     
Diff between September 15 and August 13 2007:
      Anders changes to scoring rules (I assume these are OK).
      Remove unused :error in slit problem givens.
      Change number on problem pot1b pot2c.
      Remove zero term in projection equations.
      Change hint for drawing displacement vector.
      New operator draw-accel-given-zero-net-force replacing some accel-at-rest.
      Change to cross product dropping known zero terms changes:
         Associated equations now have an explicit zero.
         Unneeded components are no longer prompted by the help.
         Unwanted side effect: if the general form is used, the help 
            system can complain the student is using unneeded variables.

Diff between October 5 and Sept. 15, 2007.
      now have time slot in relative-position def-qexp
      lots of changes to scoring, including capitalization of subscores
      change naming for B-field variable
      fix wording on projection equation hint.
      remove keyword pairs not done by subst-bindings
      operators for defining angle-between changed around.

      There are still 112,000 lines of diff that are not fully analyzed.
      Some are:
        There are some zero projections which are no longer recognized.
          The previous fix, using an implicit-eqn, would also remove
          zero projections which are needed for the solution.
        Internal form of cross and dot now contain all terms.
        Hints for needed zero projection equations where it used to say "done."
        Some change from DRAW-COMPO-FORM-AXES to DRAW-PROJECTION-AXES due to
          removal of implicit-eqn from compo-parallel-axis.
        Wording of draw line hint.

        New angle-direction for lines does not allow substitution
        into snells law formula when angles are known.  
        Need write-angle-direction-known to also work for lines.  Bug #1407
