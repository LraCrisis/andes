Possible projects for capstone projects:

Two semester course.  Starting either fall or spring.  So we are
shooting for jan.  Proposals are pretty vague. Team projects, 5 to 6
students.  Specs done as part of the project.  Need a demo at the end
of the first semester.  Second semester is testing & scaling.
Generally about twice as many projects to choose from as teams.  Team
meets once or twice a week with proposers, often by phone.

1. "Learning from students homework"  Analyze log files in real time 
to provide advice to physics instructors.  Instructors adjust lectures 
based on data from problems done the night before.  Sometimes called
"Just in time" teaching.
  a.  Diagnose common errors.
  b.  What principles have been mastered by student.
  c.  Useful delivery to the instructor, maybe in the form of 
      a set of problems?  (Kurt has experience with this for the
      subtraction tutoring.)  Maybe infer from syllabus a list of 
      course objectives.
  d.  First semester:  do with existing log files.

2.  Based on log files, suggest problems that will help students prepare
for an exam.  Adaptive task selection.

3.  Address the equation parser.  Instructors use latex, but students
find it difficult to learn.  Cramster has equation palette, which 
students seem to use but instructors seem to hate.  First activity
would be to survey what various software does for
math entry:  Maple, MathCad, Maxima, Mathmatica.  Then develop
parser.  It should have API to Andes for reducing ambiguity.  Outputs
in MathML?  No, need something like Mathematica's.  (two possible levels of 
representation:  semi-visual like LaTeX or full parse like mathematica).
  a.  Start with existing parser.  Interesting idea of resolving
      parse ambiguities with context information (model solution plus
      previous entries).
  b.  Choose parser technology (Yacc Bison ...)
  c.  Replicate existing Andes functionality, fix outstanding unary
      minus bug, add space as multiplication operator.
  d.  Survey input methods for math:  mathematica, maple, etc.
  e.  Survey learning methods for math input (Microsoft eqn editor palette,
      WebAssign's new palette, )
  f.  Choose methods to design and implement.
  g.  test on novice users in lab.
Are there IRB issues?

4.  The cascading text for defing variables.  When does one download from
server?  By character, by tab-deliminted segments or whole tree
structure?  See http://www.andestutor.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1488#c0
We will need a "prototype" working method ready for June.
  a.  Question of what is on server and what is on client.
  b.  minimum edit distance as control condition.
  c.  impliment "semantic parse" method as alternative?

5.  Develop log player for Andes3 interface.
  a.  Architect with model-view-controller so that as system changes,
      the log player automatically keeps up.
  b.  Offline version?
  c.  Add keyboard and mouse logging.

6.  Duplicate WebAssing effort on Lon-Capa.  But they build
relationships then disappear.

7.  Replace the mysterious scoring scheme with game theory
perspective: if only 2 choices, then always correct on second choice.
Better penalty for guessing.  
  a.  Survey instructors for grading:  give me your rubric.
      (show problem and worked solution)
        How would you assign points for this problem?
  b.  Impliment in code.
  c.  Storage scheme.  
  d.  Interface for instructor customization.
  e.  Test on users, test on log files.

8.  Customization.  Survey physics instructors to find out what are
the rubrics used during hand grading.

9.  Method for implementing 3-D vectors.  We will need a "prototype"
working method ready for June.
  a.  How to do this?  (present method not optimal)
  b.  Maybe test several methods.

In general, open source licensing:
  a.  Survery of open source licensing.
  b.  List project goals and find license well-aligned with those goals.
  c.  Apply license and release on public repository.
