This is the client-server API  for Andes3

Definitions:

user session:  each instance of a student trying to solve a problem.  It
is marked by a unique integer.

controller script:  This is a script running on the web server that receives 
http requests, sends them on to the appropriate lisp process, and then 
forwards the reply from the lisp process back to the client.  It may also 
log messages.

lisp process:  This is a process running the help system for one or more
user sessions.  It is assumed to be already running and ready for input.
That is, the process is neither started or stopped by the controller script.

The the following design decisions have not been made and the 
API should be agnostic to them:

1.  Does a single lisp process handles one or many user sessions?

2.  Does one allow for multiple sessions on one machine?

3.  Is logging done by the lisp process or by the controller script on
     the web server?  There is a lisp interface to SQL type databases, so we
     could have the lisp process handle the logging.

The idea here is to go through the demo in http://www.andestutor.org/AAPT-2007 and 
describe how the communication would look in json format.

"id" a unique integer assigned to each user session.

"time" is in seconds since some arbitrary start time, perhaps the beginning
of the user session.  May include decimal fractions;  the intent is to use the
javascript t.getTime()/1000.  This should not be used to infer the absolute
time associated with a user session; absolute time on client machines cannot be trusted.
