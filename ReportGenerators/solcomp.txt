************************************************************;
  A cannon is on the slope of a hill 100.0 m down the slope from a castle. Theslope makes an angle of 13 degrees with respect to the horizontal.  If the cannon is pointed 40 degrees above the horizontal and fires at the castle, what is the magnitude of the intial velocity if the cannonball is tohit the castle?  Ignore the effects if air resistance.
