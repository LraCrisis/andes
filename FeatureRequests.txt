This file is intended to serve as an archive of feature requests, ideas, 
additions,e tc for the Andes system.  It is a basic text database and 
contains features in the following form:

Title:	Prompt To define sought Var.
Author:	Collin Lynch.
Desc:	When NSH asks the student to identity the sought variable we
	Prompt them to then define a variable for the sought immediately.
	Following that we will then continue NSH as normal by prompting 
	them to identify the first principle.
Priority: Low, very low.
Status:	  On Hold.

Title:	Alter NSH to deal with hybrid problems.
Author:	Collin Lynch.
Desc:	Up until now we have assumed (when defining NSH) that there were 
	three (formerly two) distinct problem types: 
	 no-quant: where the students must complete a series of steps to 
	  satisfy some internal non-quantity goal such as defining 
	  A free body diagram.
	 MC-only: where the students must select from a multiple-choice 
	  answer and does not need to make any other entries.
	 Quant: All the other typical problems.

	In the future however we may be adding more hybrid questions wherin
	the students might calculate the magnitude of a vector and then 
	answer a multiple choice question about its value for example.
	
	If these are added it will be necessary to modify NSH to deal 
	smoothly with such problems.
Priority: Low.
Status: On Hold.

Title: Problem Specific Constraints
Author: Collin Lynch
Desc:  Add a variableMarks field to the problem struct so that constraints
       such as positivie can be defined for a specific problem in addition
       to the general quantities that are defined for all problems.
Priority: High
Status:	  Done
