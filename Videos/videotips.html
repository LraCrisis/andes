<p>Troubleshooting Tips:
<ul>
   <li>Clicking a video link should launch 
   <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.aspx">Windows Media Player.</a>
   If Media Player gives error messages, try the following workaround:
     <ol>
       <li> <b>Right-click</b> on the video link to get a pop-up menu. </li>
       <li> Select <b>Save Target As</b> (Internet Explorer) or <b>Save Link As</b> (Firefox) to download the .wmv video file to your computer </li>
       <li> Choose to save the .wmv video file on your desktop </li>
       <li> Double-click the .wmv video file you just downloaded to play it. </li>
     </ol>
   </li>

   <li> <b>Firefox users:</b> Install the <a href="http://port25.technet.com/pages/windows-media-player-firefox-plugin-download.aspx">Windows Media Plugin for Firefox</a> or else use the workaround above.</li>

   <li> Media Player reports missing codec? Install the <a href="http://www.voiceage.com/acelp_eval_eula.php"> ACELP.net audio codec. </a></li> 
</ul>

<p>
For best viewing:
<ul>
   <li> Make sure your sound is on, your speakers/headphones are plugged in, and your system/speaker volume controls are set appropriately.</li>
   <li>Enlarge the Media Player window until you get a good appearance, either by
   clicking and dragging on the window border or by using the maximize button located in the upper right-hand corner (second from the right).  
   You may need to put the player into <em><b>full-screen mode</b></em> to get an adequate viewing size: 
   <ul>
   	<li> To enter full screen mode:&nbsp; hold down the <em><b>Alt</b></em> key and press <em><b>Enter</b></em>. 
   	<li> To exit full-screen mode:&nbsp; type <em><b>Alt-Enter</b></em> again or by hitting <em><b>ESC</b></em>.
   </ul>
   You can also switch in or out of full-screen mode by double-clicking on the video image or by right-clicking on the video image and selecting "Full Screen" or "Exit Full Screen" from the popup menu.</li>
   <li>A screen resolution of <b>1024 x 768</b> or higher is required for adequate appearance.  </li>
 </ul>
