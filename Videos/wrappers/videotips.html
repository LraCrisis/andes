<ul>
	<li>Videos play in&nbsp; 
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.aspx">
	Microsoft's Windows Media Player</a></li>
<li> Videos are best viewed in <em><b>full-screen mode</b></em>. When Media 
Player is active: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To <i>Enter</i> full-screen mode: 
hold <b>Alt</b> and press <b>Enter</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To <i>Escape</i> from full-screen mode: type <b>Esc</b><br>
</li>
<li>Make sure <b>sound</b> is on and volume is up.</li>
<li>Screen resolution of <b>1024 x 768</b> or higher is required for 
adequate appearance.</li>
<li> To save a video to your hard drive: right-click on a video link

</ul>

<p>Problems viewing videos? <a href="mailto:help@andestutor.org">Email the

<b>Common Problems:</b>
<ul>
<li> "The audio codec identified by the format tag 130 is required to play this file."<br>
	   Install the ACELP.net audio codec, obtainable from <A href="http://www.voiceage.com/acelp_eval.php">VoiceAge</A> or other sources on the Web.</li> 
</ul>

<b>Note: Do not view in Internet Explorer's Media Bar </b><br>
<ul>
   <li>If you are asked "Do you want to play the item in Internet Explorer?", select "No". </li>
   <li>If the video starts playing in a small video box in a bar embedded along the left hand side of your IE browser window:</li>
   Click the small black down arrow next to the video title or "Media Options" at left, just above the player controls. Select "Settings" and uncheck "Play web media in the bar"  Close the media bar by clicking the "X" at the top right of the bar and start again.
   <li>If that doesn't work, try detaching the video player window from the "Media Bar": click the icon with a diagonal arrow in a box (at right, just above the player controls.) Drag the edges of the detached window to enlarge it, or put it into full screen mode by double-clicking on the video image. Exit full screen as above. 
</ul>
