      Instructions for Installing Andes

Andes works with several varieties of lisp, but
has been used most extensively with sbcl and Allegro lisp.
A sample ~/.sbclrc file has been included as sbclrc-sample.
Andes uses asdf as its package manager; both the sbcl and 
Allegro lisp distributions include asdf.

Install the uffi lisp package uffi; see http://uffi.b9.com/.
Use asdf-install to do this, you will need to adjust 
permissions/ownership for /usr/local/lib/sbcl/site:
  (require 'asdf-install)
  (asdf-install:install 'uffi)

Compile the solver library:
  cd Algebra/src/; make

For the system to work, a library of problem definitions 
must be included.  The original Andes problem definitions
are under copyright and not publicly available.  For access,
send your ssh public key to help@andestutor.org  The git command
to download this library is (from the Andes root directory):
   git clone ssh://git@andestutor.org/home/git/Andes-problems.git/ problems
Likewise, at least for Andes2, one can use the solutions repository:
   git clone ssh://git@andestutor.org/home/git/Andes-solutions.git/ solutions

=============== Web Server =================================

# Install the hunchentoot web server ttp://www.weitz.de/hunchentoot/
# using asdf-install.  asdf-install broken in that it will try to load
# packages we said we didn't need, like cl+ssl and its dependent cffi.
  (require 'asdf-install)
  (push :hunchentoot-no-ssl *features*) ;we have apache to do this
  (asdf-install:install 'hunchentoot)
  (asdf-install:install 'cl-json)

# Install mod_lisp.  
  svd checkout http://www.fractalconcept.com:8000/public/open-source/mod_lisp/ mod_lisp
  cd mod_lisp
# You will need apxs, on RedHat-like systems:
  yum install httpd-devel
  /usr/sbin/apxs -i -c -a mod_lisp2.c # -a flag LoadModule line to httpd.conf
# In httpd.conf, add:
  <Location /help>
    LispServer 127.0.0.1 8080 "help"
    SetHandler lisp-handler
  </Location>
# add links to web-UI and images in /var/www/html
# Then restart:
  /sbin/service httpd restart

# To run server in lisp:
  (rhelp)
  (webserver:start-help)
  (webserver:stop-help)
