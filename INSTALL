Andes works with several varieties of lisp, but
has been most extensively used with sbcl and Allegro lisp.
A sample .sbclrc file has been included as sbclrc-sample.
Andes uses asdf as its package manager; both sbclr and 
Allegro lisp distributions include asdf.

Install the uffi lisp package uffi; see http://uffi.b9.com/.

Compile the solver library:
  cd Algebra/src/; make

For the system to work, a library of problem definitions 
must be included.  The original Andes problem definitions
are under copyright and not publicly available.  For access,
send your ssh public key to help@andestutor.org  The git command
to download this library is (from the Andes root directory):
   git clone ssh://git@andestutor.org/home/git/Andes-problems.git/ problems
