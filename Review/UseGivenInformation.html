<body>
When the value of the sought quantity is mentioned
in the problem statement, then you should select "Use given information."&nbsp;
For instance, if the problem says, "A 10 kg. block slides down an inclined
plane..." and you are seeking the mass of the block, then select "Use given
information" when Andes asks "What method should be used to find it?"
<p>This is also the right selection to make when the problem does not explicitly
state the value, but implies it directly.&nbsp; For instance, if the problem
says, "A block starts at rest and slides down an inclined plane...." and
you are seeking the initial velocity of the block, then you can select
"Use given information."&nbsp; Even'though the problem does not explicitly
say that the block's initial velocity is zero, it does say that the block
is at rest initially, which directly implies that its initial velocity
is zero.
