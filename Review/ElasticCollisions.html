   <title>ElasticCollisions</title>

<body>
An <b><i>elastic</i></b> collision is defined as one in
which the total kinetic energy is conserved. If a collision is known to
be elastic, one may&nbsp; use this fact to equate the total kinetic energy
in the system before and after the collisions. The kinetic energy K of
a body is defined as (1/2) * m * v^2, and the total kinetic energy in a
system is the sum of the kinetic energies of each moving body in it. Thus
for elastic collisions you can write
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K1i + K2i = K1f + K2f
<br>or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1/2)*m1*v1i^2 + (1/2)*m2*v2i^2 = (1/2) *m1*v1f^2
+ (1/2)*m2* v2f^2
<p>where "i" is used on initial values and "f" is used on final values.
<p>Note that while the law of <a href="ConservationOfMomentum.html">conservation
of momentum </a>applies to every collision, the further principle of conservation
of kinetic energy for elastic collisions may <i>only</i> be applied if
you know&nbsp; the collision can be treated as elastic. In other collisions,
a significant fraction of the kinetic energy may be converted into other
forms of energy, such as thermal energy, so is not conserved.
