   <title>MassOfACompoundBody</title>
</head>
<body>
When two or more objects move together, then it usually
simplies the problem solving to treat them as a single "compound body."
<br>Whenever a compound body is used, its mass is just the sum of the masses
of its parts.
<p>For instance, if horse pulls a cart containing a man and an woman, and
the problem asks you to determine the force exerted on the cart by the
horse, then the problem will be simpler if you define a compound body consisting
of the man, the woman and the cart.
<br>In this case, the mass of the compound body is just the sum of the
mass of the cart, the mass of the man and the mass of the woman.
