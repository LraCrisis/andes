When an object is close to a planet and it has no support, it is said to
be in "free fall."&nbsp; For instance, if you toss a ball upwards, then
it is free fall until it lands, even though it is first rises then falls.
<p>When an object is in free fall, and if we ignore air friction, its acceleration
is always the same, regardless of the mass of the object.&nbsp; The acceleration
is straight down and its magnitude is denoted by the constant g.&nbsp;
Thus, for any object in freefall with neglible air friction, the following
equation holds:
<ul>
<li>
a = g, where a is the magnitude of the acceleration of the object.</li>
</ul>
An object is not "close to a planet"&nbsp; if we are considering an orbital
motion problem.&nbsp; For a discussion of what "close to a planet" means
see <u>orbital motion</u>.
