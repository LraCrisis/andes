   <title>KineticFriction</title>
</head>
<body>
When an object slides along a surface, the surface exerts
a retarding force called the kinetic friction force.&nbsp; The magnitude
of this force is given by:
<ul>
<li>
Ffk = <font face="Symbol">m</font>k*Fn</li>
</ul>
where Ffk is the magnitude of the kinetic friction force, Fn is the magnitude
of the normal force on the object due to the surface, and <font face="Symbol">m</font>k
is the&nbsp; coefficient of kinetic friction.&nbsp; The direction of the
frictional force is opposite to the direction of the motion of the object
with respect to the surface.
