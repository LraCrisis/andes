  <title>Spherical Mirror</title>
</head>
<body>
The focal length of a spherical mirror gives the distance from the mirror
to a point at which parallel incoming rays converge. For a spherical mirror
that is small with respect to its radius of curvature, the focal length is
equal to half the radius of curvature:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f = r/2<br>
<br>
By convention, &nbsp;focal length and radius of curvature are <b>positive</b>
 for a concave mirror, <b>negative</b> for a convex mirror. A positive focal
length means that parallel incident rays are focussed to a point in front
of the mirror. A negative focal length means that parallel incident rays
are reflected so as to form a virtual image that appears to be <i>behind</i>
 the mirror. <br>
