<body>
The average speed of an object is defined&nbsp; by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
v = s/t
<br>where v is the average speed, s is the distance travelled and t is
the duration of the trip.&nbsp; "Distance travelled" means the length of
the path followed by the object.&nbsp; This is different from the displacement
of the object.&nbsp; For instance, if you swim a 100 m race in a 50 m swiming
pool, then your distance travelled is 100 m but your displacement is approximately
zero, because you end up where you started.&nbsp; If your swim takes 80
seconds, then your speed is 100 m / 80 s = 1.25 m/s.&nbsp; However, your
average velocity is zero, because average velocity is displacement divided
by duration.&nbsp;&nbsp; So remember that speed and distance traveled refer
to motion along the path, whereas displacement and velocity refer to the
difference between the starting position and the ending position.
