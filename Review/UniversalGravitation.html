Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that
the magnitude of the gravitational force of attraction Fg between any two
objects of mass m1 and m2 is&nbsp; proportional to both the masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between them:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fg = G * m1 * m2 / r^2
<p>This law applies when r is the distance between point particles. Extended
bodies may be modelled as point particles if they are very small with respect
to the distance between them. Newton also proved that for two spheres of
uniform mass distribution, this formula gives the correct force if r is
taken to be the distance between the centers of the two spheres. Large
extended bodies like the Earth and the Moon should be approximated as such
uniform spheres in Andes problems. The force of gravity will therefore
point along a line between their centers.
<p>The constant of proportionality G is known as the gravitational constant;
its value has been measured experimentally. In Andes problems you should
enter the value of G as:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
= 6.67 E-11 N*m^2/kg^2
<p>Note&nbsp; there is a negative sign after the "E". The value above is
written using scientific notation for 6.67 times 10 to the minus 11th power,
or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0.0000000000667
<br>So G has a very small value, which accounts for the fact that we do
not notice any gravitational attraction between ordinary-sized objects
in our daily experience.
