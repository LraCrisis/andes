  <body>
   <b>Loop Rule</b>:&nbsp; The sum of the <b>potential changes</b> around 
any closed path of a circuit must be zero.<br>
   &nbsp;<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +/-V1
+/-  V2 +/- V3 +/- &#8230; = 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   &nbsp;<br>
 In Andes the symbol for the potential change across a circuit element, like 
a resistor , a capacitor or a battery, is Vi.&nbsp; Vi for each type of element 
is given by<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resistor :&nbsp; Vi = Ii*Ri&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
where Ii is the current through Ri<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacitor: Vi = qi/Ci&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
where qi is the charge on Ci<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Battery:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vi 
   = Vbi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where Vbi is the emf of 
   the battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inductor:&nbsp;&nbsp; Vi = -L*dI/dt&nbsp; (Note: In Andes dI/dt, the time rate of change of the current through the 
   inductor, is written as dIdt.) 
   <p>
 <br>
 <b>NOTE:&nbsp; When the sum for use in the loop rule is constructed, the 
sign in front of each Vi term is determined by the "direction", which determines 
the sign of the changes in potential.&nbsp; </b>The convention for each circuit 
element is<br>
 (1) Potential change across a resistor is&nbsp;&nbsp; -Vi , <b>if the current 
is in the direction of sum</b>, because this represents going from high to 
lower potential. It is +Vi otherwise.<br>
 (2)&nbsp; Potential change across a capacitor&nbsp; is -Vi,<b> if the direction 
of the sum is from positive plate to negative plate,</b>&nbsp; because this 
represents going from high to lower potential.&nbsp; It is +Vi otherwise.<br>
 (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential change across a battery is +Vi,<b> if the 
direction of the sum is from negative plate to positive plate</b>, because 
this represents going from low to higher potential.&nbsp; It is -Vi otherwise.<br>
   (4) Potential across an inductor is +Vi, <b>if the current is in the 
   direction of the sum</b>. It is -Vi otherwise. This differs from the 
 treatment of resistors because the equation for voltage across an inductor is 
   conventionally written with a negative sign in it (see above). </p>
   <p><br>
 In each of these cases the <b>direction of the sum</b> is the direction
that one is going around the closed loop to construct the loop rule sum.&nbsp; 
See the examples below.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
   <b>Capacitors example</b>:&nbsp; In the figure below, take the loop abcdefga 
 and get<br>
   &nbsp;<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vb1 - V1
-  V2 - V3 = 0 &nbsp;and use V1 = q1/C1, V2 = q2/C2 and V3 = q3/C3<br>

   <b>Resistors example</b>: In the figure below, take the loop abcd and
apply  Kirchhoff's loop rule to get<br>
   &nbsp;<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -V2 -V3 - 
Vb2 + Vb1 = 0 and use V2 = I3*R2 , V3 = I1*R3<br>
