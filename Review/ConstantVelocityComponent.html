If a component of acceleration a_x is equal to zero
during some interval, then the component of velocity in that direction,
v_x, remains constant during that interval. In this case you can apply
the following equations to the the x components of motion:
<ul>
<li>
vf_x&nbsp; = vi_x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
final velocity component = initial velocity component</li>

<li>
d_x = vi_x * t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
x component of displacement&nbsp; = constant velocity component * time</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;where vi_x and vf_x are the x-components of&nbsp; the initial and
final velocities of the object and d_x is the x-component of the <i>displacement</i>
of the object.
<p>These relations are special cases of the <a href="ConstantAcceleration.html">constant
acceleration </a>equations for the case when acceleration is zero.
<p>Tip: To avoid making sign errors, always write these equations in terms
of the vector components, then rewrite it in terms of magnitudes if necessary
by substituting in <a href="ProjectionEquations.html">projection equations</a>.
<br>Note that these equations may apply only to one component of the motion.
