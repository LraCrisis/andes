  <title>Lens Equation</title>
</head>
  <body>
  Images formed by a thin lens or a spherical mirror are characterized by 
the equation:<br>
 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1/do + 1/di = 1/f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <br>
 <br>
 using the following <b>sign conventions</b>:<br>
 
<ul>
      <li>do = object distance is <b>positive</b>  for an object on the side 
from which the light is coming; <b>negative</b>  if the object is on the other
side.</li>
  <li>f = focal length is <b>positive</b>  for <b>converging</b> lenses and
    <b>concave </b>mirrors; <b>negative</b> for <b>diverging</b>  lenses
and <b>convex </b>mirrors.</li>
   <li>di = image distance is<b>&nbsp;</b>positive for real images and negative 
for a virtual image:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For a <b>lens: </b>di is<b> </b><b>positive</b>  if the image is
on the <b>opposite side</b> of the lens from where the light is coming;<b>
  negative</b> if on the <b>same side.</b></li>
    <li>For a <b>mirror</b>: di is <b>positive</b> if&nbsp; the image is
      <b>in front of</b> the reflecting surface; <b>negative</b> if the image
is <b>behind</b> the mirror..<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 <b>Note:</b> For an object at infinity (a very large distance away), the
term 1/do is effectively zero, so in this case the above equation reduces
to <br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;di = f<br>
 In the symmetrical situation where the rays are parallel when they leave 
an optic system, &nbsp;the image distance is infinite, the term 1/di is effectively 
zero, &nbsp;so the equation reduces to<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do = f<br>
