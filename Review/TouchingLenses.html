<body>
When two lenses are touching, they may be treated as a single compound lens
with focal length f12 given by:<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/f12 = 1/f1 + 1/f2<br>
<br>
where f1 and f2 are the focal lengths of the individual lenses. <br>
<br>
This special case formula can be derived from the<a href="LensEquation.html">
 lens equation</a>
 together with the method for solving <a href="CombinedLenses.html">combined
lenses</a>
, taking the distance between lenses to be zero.<br>
