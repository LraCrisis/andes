   <title>ForceOnACompoundBody</title>
</head>
<body>
If there is a forceful interaction between a compound
body part and an object outside the compound (i.e. an external force) then
there is an interaction of the same type between the compound and the object.
<p>The general rule is that the magnitude of a force of type F on the compound
is the sum of the magnitudes of the forces of type F from that agent on
the parts.&nbsp; This sum rule is needed to handle cases where the same
agent may have an interaction of the same type with several of the bodies.&nbsp;
For example, if two blocks are pushed side by side along a plane, the net
normal force from the plane on the compound is the sum of the normal forces
from the plane on each of the blocks; similarly for kinetic friction on
the compound.
<p>As another exmaple, in the case of weight, the magnitude of the weight
force on the compound is just the sum of the magnitudes of the weight forces
on the parts.
<p>It is important that the forces acting on the part not only have the
same type but they have the same agent.&nbsp; For instance, if string A
is attached to block 1 and string B is attached to block 2, then it doesn't
make sense to define a tension for on the compound body due to both string
A and string B.&nbsp; A force an only have one agent.&nbsp; However, if
a man pushes on both blocks 1 and 2, then we could define an applied force
on the compound body due to the man.
