  <title>Amp&egrave;re's Law</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Consider a surface <var>S</var>, like the one shown below.&nbsp;
Amp&egrave;re's Law for steady currents and fields states that the
integral of <b>B</b>*d<var>l</var> around a closed path <var>C</var> that
surrounds the surface is related to the net current that passes through
the surface <var>S</var> by
<p align="center">
	 &int; <b>B</b>*d<var>l</var> = &mu;0*(&plusmn;<var>I</var>1 &plusmn;
              <var>I</var>2 &plusmn; &hellip;) </p>
<p>The sign associated with each current is determined by an application
of the right-hand rule.&nbsp; When the fingers of the right hand are
curled in the direction of the integration around the closed path <var>C</var>
the thumb of the right hand will point in the direction of positive
current.&nbsp; Using this rule, <var>I</var>1 in the figure below will have a
positive sign and <var>I</var>2 will have a negative sign when one constructs
the sum of currents on the right-hand side of Amp&egrave;re's Law.&nbsp;

<p>Amp&egrave;re's Law is often used to calculate expressions for magnetic
fields in cases of high symmetry like finding the magnetic field due to a
long, straight current carrying wire.
