Choosing Coordinate Axes</h1></center>

<dl>While any choice of direction for the coordinate system will result
in the same answer, it is a good idea to choose the axes carefully to make
solving the resulting equations easier.&nbsp; In general, you should try
to choose the axes to follow one of two rules.
<p>1.&nbsp; First, if there is a known direction of acceleration, choose
one axis to be along the direction of acceleration.
<p>2.&nbsp; In statics cases choose a direction for the axes so that as
many vectors as possible line up with either the x- or y-axis.&nbsp; For
example, in the figure below a choice of an axis that is tilted with respect
to the horizontal<sup>&nbsp; </sup>results in two vectors lining up with
the axes, while the standard horizontal and vertical alignment results
in only one vector lining up.&nbsp; The tilted axis could be a better choice
in this case.
<p>Andes can only give help if you choose an axis that is a good choice
for the problem you are working on.
<p>NOTE: In the current version of Andes the x axis can only be oriented
between 0 and 90 degrees in a CCW direction with respect to the right pointing
horizontal. However, this restriction will still allow the rules above
to be followed, although one might have to rotate the system to point a
negative x or y axis in a specified direction.</dl>
