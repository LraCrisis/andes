;;;    List of quantities associated with various "features"
;;;
;;; The routine building the featuresets allows inheritance.
;;; A featureset is "eligible" if it contains no members equal to itself.
;;; If f1 is a feature in featureset A and f1 is also the name of an 
;;; eligible featureset B=f1, then the features in B are appended to A.
;;;
;;; Routines for generating features.tsv appear at the end.
;;;
;;; The following features enable custom dialog boxes on the workbench:
;;;   speed, angle, energy, current, voltage, resistance, capacitance,
;;;   duration, probablity, time-constant
