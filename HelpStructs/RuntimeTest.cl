;;; This file defines the runtime-test struct and the code that 
;;; is used to load and store them.  The runtime-test struct is 
;;; used to represent the statistical tests that are used for 
;;; autograding at runtime.  These tests are used to calculate 
;;; the students behavior.  The definitions can be found in 
;;; KB/runtimetests.cl.  The Process code is located in 
;;; help/Statistics.cl.
;;;
;;; The tests themselves will be loaded and executed at runtime.
;;; When stored they will be loaded by means of a custom reader 
;;; defined below.  


;;;; ========================================================================
;;;; Parameters.  
;;;; The following parameters are used to store the runtime tests and the 
;;;; scores for later use.

;;; The list of runtime tests constitutes a single list of the test functions
;;; that are to be updated during this run of Andes.  These will have to be 
;;; loaded at runtime and used by the execution and update code.  
(defparameter *Runtime-Testset* () "The runtime autocalc tests.")
(defparameter *global-Runtime-Testset* () "The runtime autocalc tests.")

;;; The list of grade-testsets consists of only those testsets that have 
;;; nonzero weight and are used to compute the student's runtime score. 
;;; This list is maintained to prevent excess searching of the full testset
;;; when we are obtaining grades.
(defparameter *Runtime-Score-Testset* () "The Scored autocalc tests.")

;;; In some cases it is necessary to execute some functions before the tests
;;; themselves are setup.  Such preparatory work is often used to cache 
;;; data or carry out other steps.  When the runtime tests are reset then
;;; any functions listed in this parameter (see the registration func below)
;;; will be called first.  
(defparameter *runtime-testset-prep-funcs* NIL "The preparatory funcs.")


;;; For many problems we will have several tests that have solution-specific
;;; values.  That is, depending upon what solution we are considering the
;;; total score is different.  In order to Facilitate this this parameter
;;; will store an index to the currently chosen solution (by number).  This
;;; index should be updated every time that the score changes.  The rubric
;;; that we use is one where the highest-score is used.  Thus this will be
;;; changed after each score update to point to the one with the highest 
;;; score value.
(defparameter *Runtime-testset-current-Solindex* 0 "The current Runtime score val.")


;;; Because it will be necessary to compute the total score each time that 
;;; the tests are updated or reset I will cache the value here in order to
;;; avoid unnecessary repetition.  When the score is requested for return 
;;; it will be taken from here.
(defparameter *Runtime-Testset-current-total-score* 0 "The current total score.")

;;; This is the pause htime total.  It will be 
;;; used at runtime as a threshold for detecting
;;; a pause.
(defparameter **Testing-Pause-Time-Threshold** (make-htime :Sec 20))

(defparameter *test-cache-eqn-entries* ())
(defparameter *test-cache-given-eqn-entries* ())
(defparameter *test-cache-axis-entries* ())
(defparameter *test-cache-objects* ())
;; for drawing-only problems:
(defparameter *test-cache-drawing-entries* ())


;;; This parameter is used in the test-cbe-get-object function below 
;;; and in the runtime test-cache-entered-objects-count function below
;;; that.  This is a handy way of caching the lookup so that it doesn't
;;; need to be re-done constantly while still staying kb-driven.
;;;
;;; Becuase of the need to reload the kb at runtime I have set this code
;;; so that this lookup will only be performed if a problem has been 
;;; loaded.  In fact this parameter will be reset each time a new 
;;; problem is loaded.  This is somewhat inefficient but it is a 
;;; nice brute-force method of handling the reload issue.  
(defparameter **Current-Body-Expression-Form** Nil
  "Cache the help-expression form of the body entryprop for later use.")




;;; On the multiple choice problems the student can only make 
;;; check-answer entries.  We want to flag these problems so
;;; that we do not penalize the students on the correct entry
;;; rate component for not making any other entries like 
;;; equations or drawings on them. This now generalized
;;; to apply to problems tagged with feature 'Final-Answer-only, 
;;; (e.g. kinematics graph reading problems that call only for
;;; entering "given" values in answer boxes).  These problems may
;;; have entries in the solution graph but they are effectively optional.

;;;; Storage
;;;; For record and backup purposes we want to keep the students scores on file.
;;;; These score values will be used in two ways.  Firstly, some but not all of
;;;; the saved scores will be loaded at runtime to keep some of the student's 
;;;; records up to date.  The scores will also be uploaded to the fileserver 
;;;; where they will be sent to the faculty on a regular basis and analysed
;;;; for teaching and research purposes.
;;;;
;;;; The code in this section will be used to format the score values for storage
;;;; and write them into the student.dat file.  It will also be called at runtime
;;;; to update the scores, reading them from the student.dat file at startup time
;;;; and using them to reset the student's scores when necessary.
;;;;
;;;; The student.dat file is formatted as an alist.  Within that file the scores
;;;; will be associated with the symbol 'runtime-test-stats'.  When Andes is 
;;;; loaded the student.dat file will be read and the 'runtime-test-stats' value
;;;; will be stored in the *runtime-testset-saved-stats* struct.  When a new 
;;;; problem is opened the reloadable scores will be loaded from there before
;;;; any other action is taken.  
;;;;
;;;; When the student has completed a problem the scores will be echoed to the 
;;;; *runtime-test-stats* struct.  Once that is done the student.dat file will
;;;; be updated with the new data.
;;;;
;;;; The scores themselves are stored in an alist associating problem names to 
;;;; lists of saved testscores.  The saved testscores themselves will be stored
;;;; in the structs defined below.  When new results are added to the lists they
;;;; will be pushed onto the saved score stack.  This will give us a saved score
;;;; session for each of the times that the student has worked on the given 
;;;; problem.  When the scores are loaded the most recent saved score will be
;;;; used.  

;;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Saved-TestScores
;;; This struct is used to store the scores themselves.  They are sorted by
;;; the Date and time (taken from the session ID) and the time (recorded by
;;; the help system) that the problem was opened (the problem-session-id).  
;;; 
;;; These scores will be stored in the student.dat file in the following form:
;;;  (Scores . (<Problem0> . <Scoreslist0>) ... (<ProblemN> . <ScoresListN>))
;;;
;;; Where:
;;;  <Problem> is the problem name as a string.
;;;  <ScoresList> is a list of saved-score structs that can be used to recreate
;;;    the initial scores.
;;;
;;; The Saved-Score structs are used to record a single score set.  This set
;;; tracks the raw value of each score as an alist along with the following
;;; fields:
;;;   problem:      The problem name nil for non-problem scores.
;;;   SessionID:    The session ID that the problem occured on.
;;;   SessionUtime: The Session Utime that the problem occurred on.

;; set-stats -- restore specified score values
;;
;; This is used by the workbench to restore persistent scores saved in the
;; the solution file on problem open. The implementation function that does 
;; the work is in HelpStructs/RuntimeTest.cl
;;
;; Argument list for this API call should be a Lisp-readable sequence of pairs 
;; of the form (score value-expr) (score value-expr) (score value-expr) ...
;; Currently the only value types we persist will be either a number for a 
;; simple count or a list of two numbers for a fractional score.  
;; Example command string:
;;
;;   (set-stats (NSH_BO_Call_Count . 3) (WWH_BO_Call_Count . 2) 
;;          (Correct_Entries_V_Entries . (3 5))
;;          (Correct_Answer_Entries_V_Answer_Entries . (0 6)))
;;
;;
;; Result: normally NIL. No indication of success or failure.

;;; Following supports new persistence via storage of persistent stats in 
;;; workbench solution file, to be restored by an API call from the workbench 
;;; on problem load.
;;; Argument for this function should be list of pairs of the form
;;;        ((score . value-expr) (score . value-expr) (score . value-expr))
;;; where value-expr is a Lisp expression suitable as an argument 
;;; set-rt-score-value. 
;;; Currently the only value types we persist will be either a number for 
;;; a simple count or a list of two numbers for a fractional score.  
;;; Example list:
;;;         ((NSH_BO_Call_Count . 3) (WWH_BO_Call_Count . 2) 
;;;          (Correct_Entries_V_Entries . (3 5))
;;;          (Correct_Answer_Entries_V_Answer_Entries . (0 6))))
;;;
;;; Note: This routine may not work on other possible types of score values (e.g. the 
;;; per-solution value lists), but it works on what we need now.
;;;
;;; Note also: a ratio score like Correct_Entries_V_Entries is updated entirely
;;; independently of the counts it depends on. So in future sessions, the 
;;; Entry_Count score will start at 0 while the Correct_Entries_V_Entries might
;;; be reset to 3 of 5. This inconsistency won't matter because the Entry_Count 
;;; statistic is never used in the score computation; rather, for ratio scores 
;;; like the correct entry rate, the numerator is bumped on every entry. (See
;;; test update functions in Testcode/Tests.cl)
