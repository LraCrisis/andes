Suppose two bodies are connected so that whenever one
moves a certain amount, the other must move by the same amount, although
not necessarily in the same direction.&nbsp; For instance, two blocks hang
from an inelastic cord that runs over a pulley would be called "connected
bodies."&nbsp; In this case accelerations of the two bodies have the same
magnitude.
