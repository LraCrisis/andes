Newton's Third Law states that forces come in pairs.&nbsp;
Whenever there is a force acting on object A due to object B, there is
an equal and opposite force on object B due to object A.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
this vector relationship is expressed in terms of components, we have
<ul>
<li>
FAB_x = -FBA_x</li>

<li>
FAB_y = -FBA_y</li>
</ul>
For instance, if a man exerts an applied force on a block of 1 N rightward,
then the block exerts a&nbsp; force on the man of 1 N leftward.
