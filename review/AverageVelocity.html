   <title>AverageVelocity</title>
</head>
<body>
The average velocity is defined as the displacement over
a time interval divided by the duration of the interval.&nbsp; Since displacement
is a vector, so is average velocity.&nbsp; For instance, suppose that the
following is a&nbsp; map of Ozzie's route as he shops at K-mart:
<br><img SRC="imageRK9.JPG" height=170 width=220>
<br>The light line show's Ozzies path from the entry to the check-out stand.
The heavy arrow is his displacement from the entry to the check-out stand.&nbsp;
If Ozzie makes this trip in about 30 minutes (1800 seconds), and the magnitude
of his displacement is 50 m, then his average velocity is
<br><img SRC="imageH6T.JPG" height=84 width=196>
<br>That is, the average velocity is a vector parallel to the displacement
and of length 50 m / 1800 s = 0.028 m/s.
<p>This principle is potentially useful when an object is moving along
any path whatsoever (i.e., it need not be straight) and the sought quantity
is either
<ul>
<li>
a displacement</li>

<li>
an average velocity, or</li>

<li>
a duration</li>
</ul>
In particular, the principle can be applied in 3 forms to find an average
velocity:
<ul>
<li>
v_x = d_x / t, where v_x and d_x refer to the <i>component along the x-axis</i>
of the vectors, (<b>v</b> and <b>d</b>).</li>

<li>
v_y = d_y / t, where v_y and d_y refer to the <i>component along the y-axis</i>
of the vectors</li>

<li>
v = d / t, where v and d refer to the <i>magnitudes</i> of the vectors.</li>
</ul>
When ojects that are moving in a straight line or a circle, there are specialized
principles that apply to these cases.
