When a rigid object is rotating about a fixed axis, every point on
the object rotates through the same angle in a given time and each point
follows a circular path at some perpendicular distance, r, from the axis.&nbsp;
Since all points turn through equal angles in equal times, all points on
the object have the same angular velocity.&nbsp; The relationship between
the magnitude of the velocity, v, of a point on the object and the angular
velocity, w, of the rotation is
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v = r*<font face="Symbol">w</font>
<p>Where r is the perpendicular disrance from the axis of rotation to the
point being considered.
<p>In Andes problems all axes of rotation are perpendicular to the x-y
plane or in the z direction.
