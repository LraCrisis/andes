Power is the rate at which work is done.. It represents the rate of transfer
of energy to or from the object.
<p>The <i>average </i>power supplied to an object by some force agent over
an interval t is defined as:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pavg&nbsp; = W/t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where W is the
work done by that force during the interval.
<p>The <i>average net </i>power supplied to an object over some interval
is the total work done by all forces divided by the time:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pnet = Wnet/t
<p>The<i> instantaneous </i>power supplied to an object at any instant
by an entity exerting a force on it shown to be the <i>dot product</i>
of the force and velocity vectors, which can be computed as
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P = F * v * cos(<font face="Symbol">q</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times">)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
instantaneous power</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">where</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F is the
magnitude of the force,</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v is themagnitude
of&nbsp; instantaneous velocity of the object at that time, and</font>
<br><font face="Symbol">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q
</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times">is
the angle between F and v.</font>
