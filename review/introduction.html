<ul>

<li>  Define scalar variables using the Text Tool.

<li>  When using text to define a variable, possible forms include:
      <ul>
        <li>  "m is the mass of the ball"
        <li>  "m: mass of the ball"
        <li>  "m=mass of the ball"
      </ul>

<li>  Define vector variables using the text box of the Vector Tool.  When you
     define a vector, variables for the magnitude, components, and angle
     are defined automatically.  So, for vector <var><b>F</b></var>, 
     the magnitude is <var>F</var>, 
     components <var>F_x</var> <var>F_y</var>, and angle <var>\thetaF</var> 
     are defined.

<li>  Define coordinate system before vectors using the Axes Tool.

<li>  Write equations using the Equation Tool; all variables used must
     be previously defined.

<li>  Double click on a text or equation box to make a correction, then reenter.

<li>  Hit enter after entering any information in a text box.

<li>  To find the numerical value of a quantity:
      <ul>
        <li>  Enter equations and value assignments required to solve 
            for variable <var>V</var>.
        <li>  In an equation box enter <code>V=?</code>
      </ul>

<li>  Enter the final answer in a text box in the form like 
     <code>answer:  1.23 m/s</code> or  <code>answer: v1=1.23 m/s</code>

<li> If you are stuck or confused, hit the help button, "?" at the 
    lower right corner of the help pane.

<li> If you have a comment or complaint, simply type it into the text
    box at the bottom of the help pane.  These are logged and will
    be read by us later.

</ul>

                          <h1>Known Issues</h1>

There are plenty of known problems, including:
<ul>
<li>  There is no method for handling z-axis vectors.
<li>  Multiple-choice and check boxes don't work.
<li>  Math notation (esp. Greek letters) is not handled.
<li>  The notation for entering Greek letters, like pi, is opaque.
