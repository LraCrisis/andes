<p>Andes is a tool for solving physics homework problems.&nbsp;
When solving a problem, you write your entire solution in
the drawing area, using tools in the Toolbar on the left.&nbsp;
As you complete each step of the solution, your entry will turn
<span class="incorrect">red</span> if it is incorrect or
<span class="correct">green</span> if it is correct.&nbsp;

<p>If you are stuck or unsure why an entry is incorrect, you can
ask the Andes Tutor for Help.&nbsp;  Just click on the help button
<img src="ui-images/help-button.png" class="button" alt="help button">
    at the bottom of the Tutor pane.

<p> If you have a comment or complaint, type it in the text box
     <img src="ui-images/help-text.png" class="box" alt="text input">
   at the bottom of the Tutor pane.&nbsp;  These are logged and will
    be read by us later.

<p> Your score 
     <img src="ui-images/score.png" class="box" alt="score">
    is shown on the top of the Tutor pane.&nbsp; It is based
     on the number of correct solution steps, with a penalty for
     the number of incorrect steps attempted and the number
     of "bottom-out" hints received.

<p> When you have completed a problem, click on the
     <img src="ui-images/submit-button.png" class="box" alt="submit">
     button to exit.
