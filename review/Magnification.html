  <title>Magnification</title>
</head>
<body>
The lateral magnification m of an optic element is defined as the ratio of&nbsp;
image height to object height:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m = hi/ho &nbsp; &nbsp;(definition)<br>
It follows from the <a href="LensEquation.html">Lens Equation</a>
 that the magnification can be calculated as:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m = - di/do<br>
The negative sign is needed to conform to the convention that&nbsp; magnification
is negative if the image is inverted, and positive if the image is upright.<br>
<br>
The&nbsp; net magnification of a system of two lenses is equal to the product
of the magnification of each lens:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m12 = m1*m2<br>
