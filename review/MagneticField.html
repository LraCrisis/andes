  <title>Magnetic Field</title>
</head>
<body>
The force, <b>F</b>, on a charged particle moving with a velocity, v, in
a region with magnetic field, <b>B</b>, is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>F</b> = q*<b>v x B</b><br>
<br>
In component form:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;F_x = q*(v_y*B_z - v_z*B_y)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;F_y= q*(v_z*B_x - v_x*B_z)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;F_z = q*(v_x*B_y - v_y*B_x)<br>
<br>
The magnitude of the force, F, is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;F = abs(q)*v*B*sin(angle between <b>v</b> and <b>B</b>
)<br>
<br>
and the direction of <b>F</b> is obtained by: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp; <b>F</b> is perpendicular to the plane determined
by <b>v</b> and <b>B</b>. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The direction of <b>F</b> perpendicular to the
plane is determined by using the right-hand rule which states that <b>F</b>
 is in the direction that a right-handed screw would move, if it was turned
in the direction from <b>v</b> to <b>B</b> through the smaller of the two
angles between these two vectors.&nbsp; See the diagram below.<br>

<b>IMPORTANT ANDES NOTES:</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp; The Andes workbench always considers the plane
of the screen to be the x-y plane.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; To draw a vector in the z-direction one must
use the tool on the left hand side of the screen that has a circle with a
dot in the center to specify a vector in the positive z-direction (out of
the screen) and a circle with a cross in it to specify a vector in the negative
z-direction (into the screen).&nbsp; There is also a spot in the dialog box
for vectors that allows these same designations.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp; To draw a zero length vector choose the vector tool
desired from the vector tools bar and left click in the drawing area.<br>
