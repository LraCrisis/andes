The linear momentum of an object is a vector <b>p
</b>=&nbsp;
m * <b>v, </b>where <b>v</b> is the velocity vector and m is the object's
mass. The law of conservation of [linear] momentum states that
<i>when
the net external force on a system is zero, the total linear momentum remains
constant</i>.
<p>The total momentum of a system at any time&nbsp; is the<i> vector sum</i>of
the momentum vectors of every body in the system. When momentum is conserved
this principle can therefore be applied to <i>each component</i> of the
total momentum. For a two-body system in two dimensions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p1i_x + p2i_x = p1f_x + p2f_x
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p1i_y + p2i_y = p1f_y + p2f_y
<br>where "i" is used on initial values and "f" on final values. Equivalently,
we have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m1 * v1i_x + m2 * v2i_x = m1 * v1f_x + m2
* v2f_x
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m1 * v1i_y + m2 * v2i_y = m1 * v1f_y + m2
* v2f_y
<p>This law can also be stated in vector form as <b>p1i</b> + <b>p2i</b>
=<b> p1f</b> +<b> p2f </b>or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m1 * <b>v1i</b> + m2 * <b>v2i </b>= m1 * <b>v2i</b>
+ m2 * <b>v2f</b>
<p>This law can be applied to collisions: When two bodies collide, the
force each body exerts on the other during the brief time interval of the
collision is normally very much larger than any external forces acting
on the system such as gravity or friction, so the total momentum just before
and just after the collision can be equated.
