<body>
This "principle" simply counts the number of forces acting on
an object.&nbsp; It is useful in only a few Andes problems.
<p>A good way to determine all of the forces acting on a body is to attribute
at least one force to each thing touching the body and then add additional
forces for things that can exert a force without touching.&nbsp; The first
class of forces is called <b>contact forces</b> and include, <b>tension</b>
force due to a rope or string), <b>normal</b> force due to a surface, <b>friction</b>
force due to a surface, <b>applied</b> force due to someone pushing or
pulling, <b>drag</b> force due to a fluid, etc.&nbsp; The second class
of forces are called <b>action at a distance forces</b> and include <b>weight</b>
force due to gravity, <b>electrical</b> forces due to charge and <b>magnetic</b>
forces due to moving charges.
