1.&nbsp; The <b>voltage, VL</b>, across an inductor is defined in ANDES as
the voltage difference (Vb - Va) where b is a point on the "downstream" current
side of the inductor and a is a point on the "upstream" side of the inductor,
as shown below. VL is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VL = - L*dI/dt = - L*dIdt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Andes
notation)<br>

<br>
Note:&nbsp; When one has a c<b>onstant rate of change of current </b>or when
an <b>average rate of change</b> is needed, the rate of change is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;dIdt = (I2 - I2)/t12 <br>
<br>
where t12 is the time between t1 and t2. <br>
<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; The <b>energy, UL, stored in an inductor</b> that is carrying a
current is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;UL = 0.5*L*I^2<br>
<br>
where L is the inductance of the inductor in Henrys (H) and I is the current
through the inductor in Amperes (A).<br>
