   <title>WeightLaw</title>
</head>
<body>
When a body is close to a planet, a weight force is exerted on
it by the planet.&nbsp; The Weight law states that
<ul>
<li>
Fw = m*g</li>
</ul>
where W is the magnitude of a weight force acting on a body, m is the mass
of the body and g is the acceleration due to gravity of the planet.&nbsp;
The direction of the force on the body is toward the center of the planet
which implies that the weight force is straight down.
