<body>
There are definitions of commonly encountered forces which relate
them to other quantities.&nbsp; These definitions help us to solve problems.
Principles covered in this section are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="WeightLaw.html">Weight Law</a></li>

<li>
<a href="KineticFriction.html">Kinetic Friction</a></li>

<li>
<a href="StaticFrictionMax.html">Static Friction max</a></li>
</ul>
In addition, some problems requires counting the number of forces acting
on an object, so there is a "principle" for that:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="CountForces.html">Count Forces</a></li>
</ul>
