   <title>Height and Displacement</title>
</head>
<body>
Andes uses the term "height" to refer to the height
of an object relative to the problem's stipulated zero level of gravitational
potential energy. However it is really only the <i>difference</i> between
two heights that is significant when using energy methods.
<p>If an object is displaced between times 1 and 2, the net change in height
during that interval will be equal to the vertical component of its net
displacement during that interval:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h2 - h1 = d12_y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where
d12_y is the component of displacement d12 along a vertical y axis.
<p>If <font face="Symbol">q</font>d is the orientation of the net displacement
taken counterclockwise from the horizontal, then
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; h2 - h1&nbsp; = d12 * sin (<font face="Symbol">q</font>d12)
