<body>
If a frictional force is preventing an object from moving,
it is called a static friction force.&nbsp; The maximum value that the
static friction force can have is given by
<ul>
<li>
Ffs = <font face="Symbol">m</font>s*Fn</li>
</ul>
where Ffs is the magnitude of the static friction force, Fn is the normal
force on the object due to the surface, and <font face="Symbol">m</font>k
is the coefficient of static friction.&nbsp; For instance, suppose a rocket
sled is resting on sand, and the thrust is gradually increased.&nbsp; At
first, the applied force of the thrust is balanced by the static friction
force, and the sled does not move.&nbsp; As the thrust gradually increases,
the static friction force also increases, and the sled still does not move.&nbsp;
However, just after the static friction force reaches the value given by
the equation above, the sled starts to move.&nbsp; The static friction
force has reached its maximum, and it can not longer increase as the thrust
increases.&nbsp; Thus, there is a net force on the sled and it begins to
accelerate, in accordance with <a href="NewtonsSecondLaw.html">Newton's
Second law</a>.&nbsp; The force of static friction can have any value from
zero to its maximum value, whatever is necessary to keep the object from
slipping.
