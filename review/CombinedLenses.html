When light passes through two lenses, &nbsp;you can apply the lens equation
to the first lens alone, and then treat the<b> image</b> formed by the first
lens as the <b>object</b> for the second lens, as shown below. Because the
sum of the image distance for the first lens (di1) and the object distance
for the second lens (do2) must equal the distance between the lenses (di12),
&nbsp;the object distance for the second lens is given as:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; do2 = d12 - di1<br>

This equation will work no matter where the image is formed, as long as the
<a href="LensEquation.html">sign conventions</a>
  for the relevant quantities are observed.<br>
