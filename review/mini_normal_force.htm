<h3> <font color="#003366">Normal Force</font></h3>

All solid materials are made up of atoms which interact with each
other by means of a complex variety of forces. You may visualize these
interactions as shown in the figure below. In the diagram, the yellow
balls represent atoms and the springs connecting them represent the forces between
the atoms.

The figure on the left shows a top and a side view of the surface when the body is not on it.

The figure on the right shows a top and a side view of the
surface when the body is on it.  The body compresses the
molecules of the surface. The surface's
compressed molecules push back on the body, exerting a force
perpendicular to the surface. This is called the "normal" force.  To see why its called "normal," click <a href = "mini_normal_force_direction.htm">here</a>.
