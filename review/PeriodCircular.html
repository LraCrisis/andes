The <i>period </i>T of the motion of an object moving in a circular path
is defined as the time it takes to complete one revolution around the circle.
The distance travelled during the period is the circumference of the circle
= 2*<font face="Symbol">p</font>*r, where r is the radius of the circle.
In uniform circular motion the velocity v, is constant, so the general
rule that distance = speed * time gives:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T = 2*<font face="Symbol">p</font>*r/v
<p>for uniform circular motion.
