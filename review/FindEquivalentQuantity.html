   <title>FindEquivalentQuantity</title>
</head>
<body>
If common sense, rather than a principle of physics,
tells you that two quantities are equal, then select "Find equivalent quantity."
<p>For instance, suppose the problem is, "A train leaves for Boston from
New York at the same time a car leaves for New York from Boston.&nbsp;
The train travels at a constant speed of 2 m/s for 5 hours.&nbsp; The car
makes the same trip in 4 hours.&nbsp; How fast was the car travelling?"
To solve this, you first seek the speed of the car via the principle 'average
speed = distance/time.'&nbsp; Next you must find the distance traveled
by the car.&nbsp; You know the distance traveled by the car is the same
as the distance travelled by the train.&nbsp; Thus, you can select "Find
equivalent quantity" to justify adopting the subgoal of finding the train's
distance given your goal of finding the car's distance.
