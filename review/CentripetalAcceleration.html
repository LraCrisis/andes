   <title>CentripetalAcceleration</title>
</head>
<body>
When an object is moving in a circular path and
its velocity's magnitude is constant, then its acceleration is a vector
that points towards the center of the circular path and its magnitude is
given by:
<ul>
<li>
ac = v^2 / r</li>
</ul>
where v is the magnitude of the object's velocity, r is the radius and
ac is the magnitude of the acceleration.&nbsp; Note that this only holds
when the object's motion is uniformly circular -- it is not speeding up
and slowing down, like a child on a swing, but is moving with the same
rotational speed, like a scratch on a CD.
<p>If the magnitude of the velocity (speed) of the body moving in a circle
is not constant, there is still instantaneous centripetal acceleration,
ac, given by the expression above.&nbsp; However, in this case there is
also tangential acceleration, atan, which accounts for the body speeding
up or slowing down.&nbsp; If the tangential acceleration is not zero, then
the magnitude of the total acceleration is given by
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
atot = sqrt(ac^2+atan^2)</li>
</ul>
