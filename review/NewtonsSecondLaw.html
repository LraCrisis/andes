Newton's Second Law is often stated as the vector equation
<b>F</b>
= m*<b>a</b>, where <b>F</b> is the net force on an object and
<b>a</b>
is the object's acceleration.&nbsp; Thus, in two dimensions the law can
be stated in scalar form as:
<ul>
<li>
F_x = m * a_x</li>

<li>
F_y = m * a_y</li>
</ul>
where F_x and F_y are the components of the net force along the x and y
axes, and a_x and a_y are the components of the object's acceleration along
the x and y axes.
<p>Notice that F stands for the <i>net</i> force on the body and not for
an <i>individual</i> force.&nbsp; The distinction between the net force
and an individual force is that each individual force is due to the interaction
between the body and some other object, whereas the net force is the sum
of all such forces and is thus not due to any particular object.
<p>Most solutions immediately reduce F_x or F_y to the appropriate sum
of individual forces.&nbsp; Thus, the most frequently used form of Newton's
Law is:
<ul>
<li>
F1_x + F2_x + F3_x + &#8230; = m* a_x</li>

<li>
F1_y + F2_y + F3_y + &#8230; = m* a_y</li>
</ul>
where F1, F2, F3, etc. are the individual forces acting on the body.&nbsp;
For instance, if the body is acted on by a weight force named W and a tension
force named T, then we have
<ul>
<li>
Fw_x + Ft_x = m * a_x</li>

<li>
Fw_y + Ft_y = m * a_y</li>
</ul>
Note that this only holds if W and T are the <i>only</i> forces acting
on the body.&nbsp; The sum of forces must include all the forces acting
on the body.
<p>When the object's acceleration is zero, then the equations simplify
to
<ul>
<li>
F1_x + F2_x + F3_x + &#8230; = 0</li>

<li>
F1_y + F2_y + F3_y + &#8230; = 0</li>
</ul>
This is sometimes called Newton's first law, but it is just a special case
of Newton's second law.&nbsp; It holds only when the velocity of the body
is constant, which means that the acceleration of the body is zero.
<p>A good way to determine all of the forces acting on a body is to attribute
at least one force to each thing touching the body and then add additional
forces for things that can exert a force without touching.&nbsp; The first
class of forces is called <b>contact forces</b> and include, <b>tension</b>
force due to a rope or string), <b>normal</b> force due to a surface, <b>friction</b>
force due to a surface, <b>applied</b> force due to someone pushing or
pulling, <b>drag</b> force due to a fluid, etc.&nbsp; The second class
of forces are called <b>action at a distance forces</b> and include <b>weight</b>
force due to gravity, <b>electrical</b> forces due to charge and <b>magnetic</b>
forces due to moving charges.
