   <title>EqualVelocities</title>

<body>
Suppose two bodies are connected so that whenever one moves
a certain amount, the other must move by the same amount, although not
necessarily in the same direction.&nbsp; For instance, two blocks hang
from an inelastic cord that runs over a pulley would be called "connected
bodies."&nbsp; In this case the velocities of the two bodies have the same
magnitude.
<p>A special case of this principle applies to two rotating objects coupled
by a belt which moves without slipping. In this case, the the points on
the rims of the respective objects which are in contact with the belt are
constrained to have the same speed. That is, the linear velocities of these
two points will have the same magnitude, even if the rotational speeds
of the two rotating objects are different.
