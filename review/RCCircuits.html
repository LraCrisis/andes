<b>RC CIRCUIT: CHARGING</b><br>
In the circuit shown below the switch S1 is closed at t = 0 and it is assumed
that the initial charge on the capacitor is zero.&nbsp; The charge, q, on
the capacitor at time t is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;q = Vb*C1*(1 - exp(-t/(R1*C1)))<br>
<br>
where Vb is the battery voltage.&nbsp; Note the use of parentheses in the
exponent to clearly establish that the product (R1*C1) is in the denominator
of the exponent.&nbsp; Also note, when t &gt;&gt; R1*C1,&nbsp; q = Vb*C1.<br>
<br>
Under the conditions stated above, the current through resistor R1 at time
t is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I = (Vb/R1)*exp(-t/(R1*C1))<br>
<br>
If one desires to find the time required for the charge on the capacitor
to build up to some percent of its value for very long times, Vb*C1, one
can let <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;q = (fraction)*(Vb*C1)<br>
<br>
where "fraction" is a number between 0 and 1 to represent some percent of
the final value of&nbsp; charge for very long charging times.&nbsp; For example,
for charging to 30% of Vb*C1, "fraction"=0.3.<br>
