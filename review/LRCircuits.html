1.&nbsp; Consider a circuit where a battery, an inductor and a resistor are
connected in series, as shown below.&nbsp; If the switch, S1, is closed at
t0 =0 , the current in the inductor (circuit), at a later time, t, is given
by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I2 = If*(1 - exp(- t/<font face="Symbol">t</font>)))<br>
<br>
where If = Vb/R is the current in the circuit for times very large compared
to <font face="Symbol">t</font> and <font face="Symbol">t</font> = L/R , the LR time constant for the circuit.<br>

2.&nbsp; Consider the circuit shown below where S1 has been in position a
for a long time.&nbsp; At t0=0 S1 is switched to position b, removing the
battery from the circuit.&nbsp; The current in the inductor (circuit) at
a later time t is given by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I2 = I0*exp(-t/<font face="Symbol">t</font>)<br>
<br>
where I0 = Vb/R is the current through the inductor at t=0&nbsp; and 
<font face="Symbol">t</font> and
<font face="Symbol">t</font> = L/R , the LR time constant for the circuit.&nbsp; Since the current through
an inductor cannot change instantaneously, the current through the inductor
just before S1 is moved from position a to position b must be the same as
the current just after the switch moves from a to b.<br>
