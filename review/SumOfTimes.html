Suppose a problem has three time points, T0, T1 and T2.&nbsp;
Then the duration of T0 to T2 is equation to the sum of the duration of
T0 to T1 and the duration of T1 to T2.&nbsp; That is, if the duration variables
are T02, T01 and T12, then T02=T01+T12.
<p>If you are seeking one of these durations, then you can select "Sum
of times" if you want to use this equation to find it.
