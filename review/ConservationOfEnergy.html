   <title>Conservation of Energy</title>
</head>
<body>
<b>Conservation of (Mechanical) Energy</b>
<p>There are two important cases where Conservation of Mechanical Energy
can be used.
<p>First is the case where all of the forces acting on the body are <b>conservative</b>
or path independent forces.&nbsp; In this course the only two conservative
forces are <b>gravitational </b>and<b> spring forces</b>.&nbsp; This condition
also is true when the non-conservative forces are present but do no work
(for example the normal force frequently does no work).&nbsp; For this
case
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub>
= K<sub>1</sub> + U<sub>1</sub>
<p>where K<sub>1</sub>and<sub> </sub>K<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub> </sub>are
the kinetic energy of a body at positions 1 and 2 and U<sub>1 </sub>and
U<sub>2</sub> are the potential energy of the body at positions 1 and 2.&nbsp;
The potential energy for a spring is given by
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U<sub>s </sub>= .5*k*d^2
<p>where k is the spring constant of the spring in N/m and d is the displacement
of the end of the spring from its equilibrium position.
<br>The potential energy for a body of mass m near a planet is given by
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U<sub>g</sub> = m*g*h
<br>where m is the mass of the body, g is the "acceleration of gravity"
near the surface of the planet and h is the height in meters above some
reference position.
<br>The potential energy for a mass at a greater distance from the surface
of a planet is given by
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U<sub>G</sub> = - G*m*M<sub>p</sub>/r
<p>where G = 6.67E-11 N*m^2/kg^2, Mp is the mass of the planet and r is
the distance from the center of the planet to the center of the body of
mass m.
<p>The second case for application of Conservation of Mechanical Energy
is when there are non conservative forces in addition to the conservative
forces.&nbsp; Examples of non conservative forces are friction and applied
forces like "pushes".&nbsp; In this case the Conservation of Mechanical
Energy becomes
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub>
= K<sub>1</sub> + U<sub>1 </sub>+ W<sub>12</sub>(non conservative)
<p>where W<sub>12</sub>(non conservative) is the work done on the body
by the nonconservative forces.&nbsp; Note that this work can be negative
when the force and displacement are in different directions!
