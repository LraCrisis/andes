   <title>ConstantAcceleration</title>
</head>
<body>
There are several equations that apply when an object's
acceleration is constant.&nbsp; Since acceleration is a vector quantity,
this means that both the direction and the magnitude of the acceleration
are unchanged over the time interval.
<p>The equations are potential useful when the sought quantity is
<ul>
<li>
the acceleration of the object</li>

<li>
the initial velocity of the object</li>

<li>
the final velocity of the object</li>

<li>
the displacement of the object, or</li>

<li>
the duration of the time interval</li>
</ul>
Tip: To avoid making sign errors, always write these equations in terms
of the vector components, then rewrite it in terms of magnitudes if necessary
by substituting in <a href="ProjectionEquations.html">projection equations</a>.)
<p>Given any 3 of these quantities, the remaining 2 can be derived.&nbsp;
Thus, there are many equations relating the quantities.&nbsp; It suffices
to remember a few of them and derive the other equations as needed.&nbsp;
Because they are most frequently used, the following equations are recommended
for memorization (they are written in terms of the x-components, but similar
equations exist for y-components):
<ul>
<li>
a_x = (vf_x - vi_x) / t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vf_x = vi_x
+ a_x*t</li>

<li>
vf_x^2 = vi_x^2 + 2 * a_x * d_x</li>

<li>
d_x = vi_x * t + 0.5* a_x * t^2</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;where vi_x and vf_x are the x-components of&nbsp; the initial and
final velocities of the object and d_x is the x-component of the <i>displacement</i>
of the object
<p>The first equation is also <a href="AverageAcceleration.html">the definition
of average acceleration</a>, so it can be used when the object is moving
in a curved path. If the acceleration is along the same line as the initial
velocity or if the initial velocity is zero, then the motion will be along
a straight line.&nbsp; If, however, the acceleration is not along the same
line as the initial velocity, then the motion will not be along a straight
line, as in projectile motion.
