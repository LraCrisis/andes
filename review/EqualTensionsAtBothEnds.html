<body>
Suppose two bodies are connected by an inelastic
string or string-like object od negligible mass.&nbsp; The string exerts
a tension force on each object.&nbsp; The magnitude of these two tension
forces is the same.&nbsp; Remember that the direction of the tension force
is along the direction of the string and that stings can only pull.&nbsp;
Tension forces due to a single string acting on different bodies will have
the same magnitudes, but they might have different directions.
