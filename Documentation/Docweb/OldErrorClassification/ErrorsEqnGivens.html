<h2>
Errors where a given value was equated with the wrong quantity</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/22/01)</center>

<p>Students sometimes enter the wrong values for given variables.&nbsp;
Thus, when a student equation has the form &lt;variable>=&lt;value> and
the &lt;variable> is a given quantity, and the correct equation for it
has not yet been entered, then we have a case of this type of error.&nbsp;
This are always slips, because the target equation results from just writing
a given quantity down, and there is no hint sequence associated with that
operator.

022598 Eq-USNA 37-11</h3>
If a trooper jumps from a plane at T0, falls 400m to hit the snow at 20
m/s at T1, and plows to a stop at T2 at the bottom of a 1 m crater, then
what is the net force on the trooper?&nbsp; After defining variables and
drawing a FBD, the student entered “d = 400m”&nbsp; where d is defined
as that displacement from T1 to T2, but 400m is the displacement from T0
to T1.&nbsp; The variable is required for solution, but 400m is not.
<ul>
<li>
IH identifies problem as wrong use of ‘d’ and questions definition of d
and explains it as the height of the snow in the crater.</li>

<li>
RO also sees problem with ‘d’ and uses similar explanation.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Did you really mean to use 400 for ‘d’ (the magnitude of the
displacement of the trooper during the time period from ‘T1’ to ‘T2’)?”</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp; It would be silly of Andes to help the student write the equation
that has 400m in it, as that equation is not needed for the solution of
the problem.&nbsp; So Andes should select the other interpretation and
say something like, "Check your time periods." then hint about changing
the value.</li>
</ul>
Andes replaces d with various spatial measurement quantities until it finds
that the displacment from T0 to T1 makes the equation correct.&nbsp; It
gets a second interpretation because the equation has the form &lt;quantity>
= &lt;value>, and &lt;quantity> is given, and the correct equation for
its value has not yet been entered.&nbsp; Indy analysis finds that both
equations are primitive.&nbsp; SG analysis shows that the first interpretation
is on a dead-path, but the second interpretation is part of the solution.&nbsp;
Thus, Andes prefers the second interpretation.&nbsp; There is no hint sequence
associated with the operator application for it, so Andes treats it as
a slip.&nbsp; The hint sequence is, "Check the time intervals." then "Your
value of 400m is for the time period T0 to T1, but d is for the time period
T1 to T2." then "Replace 400m with 1 m."

bee Eq-USNA 7-57</h3>
If a block is projected up a 40 degree inclined plane with an initial KE
of 16J, and it travels 0.6 m before compressing a 200 N/m spring 0.2 m,
what is its KE? The student defines variables, draws a body and axes, enters
givens, then writes "d=.2m."&nbsp; However, d is defined as the displacement
from T0 to T1, which is .8 m.&nbsp; On the other hand, 0.2m = d1, where
d1 is the student's variable for the compression of the spring at T0.
<ul>
<li>
IH sees only "d1 = 0.2m" as the closest matching equation.&nbsp; She asks,
"What is 0.2m?" then asks what variable corresponds to that quantity.</li>

<li>
RO sees only d=.8m, so he asks "what is d again?" then points out that
the displacement must be at least 0.6.</li>

<li>
Andes also addresses definition of variables and agrees with RO on student's
intended equation ("d = 0.8m")</li>

<li>
KVL: Both the d=.8 and d1=.2 interpretations are plausible, and both equations
are part of the solution.&nbsp; It doesn't matter which one Andes gives
hints on.</li>
</ul>
Andes can find the d1=0.2m interpretation by substitute various spatial
measurement quantities for d until it discoveres that d1 makes the equation
correct.&nbsp; If the value of d is given in the problem representation
instead of computed by adding, then Andes can also find the d=0.8m interpretation
because the students equation is of the form &lt;quantity>=&lt;value>,
&lt;quantity> is given, and the equation is not entered correctly yet.
Indy analysis finds that both equations is primitive, and SG analysis finds
that both are part of the solution and neither is premature.&nbsp; Andes
picks one arbitrarily, lets say d=0.8m..&nbsp; Andes finds that there is
no hint sequence for the operator application that writes the target equation.&nbsp;
Thus, it treats this as a slip.&nbsp; The hint sequence is, "Check your
time periods." then "0.2m is the displacement from T0 to T1, but your equation
needs the displacement from T0 to T2."&nbsp; then "Replace 0.2m by 0.8m."
