In the problem where the model airplane is hanging from two strings, the
student define variables, draws a correct FBD, enters several projection
equations and enters “Ft1_x = Ft1*sin45.”&nbsp; The right side should have
a minus sign.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes that there is a sign error and addresses the sign of the forces.</li>

<li>
RO also notes sign error and also addresses the sign of the forces, specifically
sign of “Ft1_x”.</li>

<li>
Andes1 says to check signs.</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp; The student has not entered NFL in component form yet, so Ande's'
first response would be to treat this as an error where the closest matching
equation is premature.&nbsp; However, entering the component equation will
probably not prevent the sign error nor help the student detect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, Andes direct the student to fill in the skipped step then ask about
this equation again.&nbsp; If they do, then Andes should hint about how
to apply the projection procedure.</li>
</ul>
Andes finds that adding a minus sign to either the right side or the left
side of the equation (or any of the factors in the mulitplication on the
right side) creates a correct equation according to color-by-numbers.&nbsp;
Indy analysis equations reveals that the correct equation is primitive,
namely,&nbsp; Ft1_x= -Ft1*sin45.&nbsp; SG analysis indicates that the compo
form of NSL needs to be done first, so Andes first hints "You skipped the
step of entering Newton's law in terms of component variables.&nbsp; Why
don't you enter that equation, then ask again about why this equation is
wrong.&nbsp; In general, its easier to remedy errors when no earlier steps
have been skipped." then teaches the compo equation, then gives a bottom
out hint for the compo equation.
<p>Suppose the student now asks again why the Ft1_x=Ft1*sin45 equation
is red.&nbsp; Andes looks up the interpretation of the equation and finds
{Ft1_x=-Ft1*sin45} again.&nbsp; Checking the solution graph reveals that
it is not premature.&nbsp; No slip heuristics fire, so Andes decides to
hint the equation.&nbsp; It retrieves the hint sequence from the operator
application that wrote the correct equation.&nbsp; The hint sequence starts
with a goal assumption ("I assume you are trying to write a projection
equation for Ft1_x.") followed by a pointing hint ("To avoid errors, you
should apply the procedure for calculating projections that involves taking
the difference between the vector’s rotation and the axis’ rotation").&nbsp;
The teaching hint reviews the procedure for generating projection equations,
either via a minilesson or a KCD.&nbsp; The bottom out hint states the
correct equation to write and why.

In the problem of the jumping kangaroo, the student draws a diagram with
initial velocity and acceleration, defines variables, and enters “d = v0(t)
+ 1/2(a)t^2” as the first equation.&nbsp; The closest matching equation
has –a instead of a.&nbsp; This equation is both premature (vectors and
the component equation should be entered first) and inefficient.
<ul>
<li>
IH fails to notice the sign error.&nbsp; She coaches the student through
solving the problem with the student’s equation, the points out that&nbsp;
“v1_y^2 = v0_y^2 - 2*a*d = 0” is more efficient.</li>

<li>
RO sees the sign error, and asks the student for the direction of acceleration.</li>

<li>
Andes says to check signs.</li>
</ul>
Andes tries inserting negations into "d", "v0*t" and "0.5*a*t^2."&nbsp;
The last one works, and it finds that the equation is correct according
to color by numbers. (Substituting a_y for a would also work.)&nbsp; Indy
analysis finds that it corresponds to d_y=v0_y*t+0.5*a_y*t^2,&nbsp; d_y=d,&nbsp;
v0_y=v0,&nbsp; a_y=–a.&nbsp; SG analysis shows that it is premature, since
the displacement vector needs to be written first.&nbsp; It also discovers
that this path is less efficient than one that uses vf_y^2=vi_y^2 + 2*a_y*d_y.&nbsp;
But that equation is also premature, as it requires the displacement vector
to be drawn.&nbsp; Thus, Andes decides to suggest drawing that vector,
as it would be the right thing to say in either case.
<p>Suppose the student draws the displacement vector then asks again why
their equation is red.&nbsp; The error diagnosis and Indy analysis are
the same, but the SG analysis indicates that hinting the target equation
will take the student down an inefficient path.&nbsp; Andes should say,
“Your equation is similar to one I know, but it is not part of an efficient
solution to the problem.&nbsp; You may click here for help on fixing your
equation or here for help on finding a more efficient solution.”&nbsp;
If the student wants help on fixing the equation, then since acceleration
is drawn, the student should first enter the equation in component form.
<p>Suppose the student now enters their kinematics equation in component
form, d_y = v0_y(t) + 1/2(a_y)t^2.&nbsp; This is correct, so the student
reenters the original equation, which turns red, and the student asks for
help again.&nbsp; The student has drawn the acceleration vector pointing
down and the +Y axis pointing up, so this is a classic sign error due to
not writing the projection equation. Although writing the equation first
in component form is required, writing the projection equations is not
required, and would be especially silly when the equation is just a_y=-a.&nbsp;

<a NAME="Kiesel 18-55"></a>Kiesel Eq-USNA 18-55 second equation</h3>
In the problem where a hailstone is falling to the ground from the sky,
the student defines variables, draws a body and standard axes, then enters
“d_y=9000m,” some other givens and “d=0+v0_y*t+(1/2)a_y*t^2.”&nbsp; Both
equations are red.&nbsp; The first one should be d_y=-9000m (the student
dropped the negative sign), but that is discussed elsewhere.&nbsp; The
second one should have d_y instead of d on the left side, or alternatively,
should have a minus sign on the left.&nbsp; Either way, the resulting equation
is an inefficient one to use for this problem.&nbsp; The tutors gave advice
on the second equation, but Andes gave advice on the first equation.
<ul>
<li>
IH didn’t notice the error.&nbsp; Instead, she wants the student to use
“v1_y^2 = v0_y^2 + 2*a_y*d_y”&nbsp; She points out that the question asks
the student to find ‘v’ not ‘d’ and questions the student’s method for
finding ‘v’ with the equation entered.</li>

<li>
RO notes “d_y = 0 + v0_y*t + 0.5*a_y*t^2” as student’s intended equation
and addresses the sign (direction) of motion.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Make sure you are using the correct signs in this equation.”</li>

<li>
KVL: In Andes2, the displacement vector would have to be drawn before the
equation can be written, so this equation is not premature.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the problem specification to the KB treats d_y=-9000m as a given rather
than the result of a projection operation.&nbsp; Thus, there is no hint
sequence on the operator application.&nbsp; Thus, Andes must treat this
error as a slip.</li>

<li>
KVL: For help on the second equation (assuming all variables are defined
by drawing vectors) Andes should say, “Your equation is similar to one
I know, but it is not part of an efficient solution to the problem.&nbsp;
You may click here for help on fixing your equation or here for help on
finding a more efficient solution.”&nbsp; If the student wants help on
fixing the equation, then Andes ought to say, “Although most of your components
are expressed as variables, one is not.&nbsp; Try rewriting the equation
will all the components expressed as variables.”</li>
</ul>
The first equation can be diagnosed by inserting a negative sign or by
<a href="ErrorsEqnGivens.html">replacing
the student's value for the given quantity (d_y) by the correct value</a>.&nbsp;
Either way, we get a correct, primitive, non-premature equation.&nbsp;
The operator application has no hint sequence, so Andes gives a slip-based
hint sequence, such as "Check your signs."&nbsp; This hint would have to
be generated by comparing the student's value to the correct value and
noticing that one is the negation of the other.
<p>For the second equation, Andes inserts a negative sign on the left,
and gets a correct but compound equation.&nbsp; Substituting d_y for d
yeilds a correct and primitive equation.&nbsp; Andes prefers the latter
interpretation.&nbsp; SG analysis discovers that it is inefficient, so
Andes gives the advice quoted above.
<h3>
<a NAME="rat 49-48"></a>rat Eq-USNA 49-48</h3>
In the problem where the aircraft carrier plows into a pier, the student
defines variables, draws a body, an axis and the initial velocity, enters
some equations, then enters “a = a_x.”&nbsp; The target equation has –a
for a..
<ul>
<li>
IH asks what would happen to the final velocity if a_x>0.</li>

<li>
RO asks “what is the direction of a?”.</li>

<li>
Andes also notes sign error.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should ask the student to draw the acceleration vector.</li>
</ul>
Substituting a_x for a yields a correct equation, a_x=a_x.&nbsp; This needs
to be ruled out as an interpretation. Negation insertion does create a
correct, primitive but premature interpretation.&nbsp; Suppose the student
draws vectors and gets the acceleration direction right (perhaps with some
coaching), then asks again why this equation is wrong.&nbsp; Same interpretation.&nbsp;
There is no sign of slips.&nbsp; Thus, it give the hint sequence for the
projection-along-an-axis operator.
<h3>
M030072 Eq-USNA 12-50</h3>
In the problem with the jumping kangaroo, after defining variables and
drawing a FBD, the student entered “vinit_y^2=2*a_y*d_y – vfinal^2” Target
equation has a negative sign on the left side of the equation.
<br>&middot; IH notices algebra manipulation error and through critique
tries to get student to figure out error on their own.
<br>&middot; RO notices same problem (sign error) but tells student there
is a sign error.
<br>&middot; Both IH and RO address v_f^2=v_o^2 + 2*a_y*d_y
<br>&middot; Andes suggests swapping variables instead of noticing the
sign problem.
<br>&middot; KVL:&nbsp; The equation should be rewritten in component form
(the vfinal needs to be vfinal_y).
<h3>
<a NAME="a5 3-43"></a>a5 Eq-Pitt 3-43</h3>
On the shopping cart problem, the student draws a complete FBD, enters
givens, a=0, all projections of forces on the x-axis, then S_x=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x,
where S is an undefined variable.&nbsp; The closest matching equation is
0=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x+Fk_x, which includes Fk_x, the x-component of the kinetic
friction force, and excludes S_x, which is undefined.
<ul>
<li>
T1 thinks S_x denotes net force, and that the student should have left
out the normal and weight forces.&nbsp; Although the student has drawn
the normal and weight forces correctly, and the student has written Fn_x=0
and Fw_x=0, T1 still asks the student what their directions are.</li>

<li>
T2 says to put components of all forces in the equation.</li>

<li>
Andes says, "You have not defined the variable S."</li>

<li>
KVL: Maybe S_x denotes the friction force, as that is the only force on
the left side of the body, and students sometimes use &lt;left forces>
= &lt;right forces> for N1L.&nbsp; Andes should first complain about the
undefined variable, then react to the revised equation.</li>
</ul>
If the student defines S as the net force, then we have a missing force,
which is discussed <a href="ErrorsEqnMissingForces.html#a5 3-43">elsewhere</a>.
On the other hand, if the student changes the S_x to Fk_x, gets red, and
asks for help, then we have a sign error.&nbsp; Andes can detect it by
inserting a negation on the left side, which produces a correct, primitive,
non-premature equation.&nbsp; However, this particular sign error should
trigger special purpose error handler hung on the N1L operator:
<blockquote><a NAME="left forces = right forces"></a>If the student wrote
an equation of the form &lt;sum of left force components> = &lt;sum of
right force components> when N1L would be correct instead, then teach/state
that, "What writing Newton's first law, it is best to put the sum of the
force components on one side of the equation, like this: 0=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x+Fk_x.&nbsp;
All the force components have positive signs.&nbsp; If you put some on
the other side of the equation, they they would have to have negative signs.&nbsp;
Many students forget the negative signs because they are thinking of a
special case, wherein all the forces are parallel to the axis, say the
horizontal axis, but some point left and some point right.&nbsp; For instance,
if FL1 and FL2 point left and FR1 and FR2 point right, then students often
write FL1+FL2=FR1+FR2.&nbsp; This equation is correct, but notice that
it has <i>magnitudes</i> in it instead of <i>components</i>.&nbsp; If it
is rewritten in terms of components, it would have to be -FL1_x-FL2_x=FR1_x+FR2_x.&nbsp;
Most students forget the negative signs when they do this.&nbsp; If they
had followed the advice above, then they would write FL1_x+FL2_x+FR1_x+FR2_x=0
and gotten the signs right.&nbsp; Thus, if you want to get the signs right,
it is best to always write the sum of forces (a) in terms of components
and (b) all on one side of the equation."</blockquote>
