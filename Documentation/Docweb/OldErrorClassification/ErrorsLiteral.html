minivan Eq-USNA 28-29</h3>
If a person of known mass is hanging from a bridge by a bungee cord, what
is the tension in the cord?&nbsp; The student defined f, m and a variables
(no FBD, though) then entered “f=m*a” as the first equation, where f is
defined as the <i>tension</i> force, not the net force.
<ul>
<li>
IH first points out the discrepancy between tension force and net force,
then asks if a has any particular value in this problem.</li>

<li>
RO doesn’t identify a correct equation but questions ‘f’ and asks for a
FBD.</li>

<li>
Andes1 says, “Maybe you should multiply by ‘G’ rather than by ‘a’ in the
right side of the equation.”</li>

<li>
KVL: Since this is a first-law problem, the &lt;net-force>=m*a equation
is not needed, and it is unlikely that she solved the whole problem in
her head and was trying the write f=m*g, which is the answer. The student
is probably using "f=m*a" as a name for Newton's law, rather than a real
equation.&nbsp; Students are often taught to provide such comments as part
of their homework solutions.&nbsp; The best advice is probably to address
this misunderstanding of how to use equations in the equation window.</li>
</ul>
Andes could find analyses for this equation by substituting the net force
for f or by substituting g for a.&nbsp; That would lead to advice similar
to IH/RO and Andes1.&nbsp; However, let's use this error handler: "If the
student's entry is literally 'f=m*a' or 'm*a=f', and the solution uses
Newton's first or second law, then say, 'Are you writing F=m*a just to
show that you intend to apply Newton's law?&nbsp; Newton's law is indeed
the right approach to solving this problem.&nbsp; However, Andes interprets
all your equations as specific statements about the problem.&nbsp; In particular,
it interprets "f=m*a" in terms of the variables f, m and a that you have
defined for this problem.&nbsp; In this case, the definitions of at least
one of those variables makes this equation inappropriate for the problem.&nbsp;
If you just want to provide an explanation to the reader, then put a semi-colon
(;) before it.&nbsp; Andes ignores everything in the box after the semi-colon."&nbsp;
This should be conveyed with a training card instead of a hint.
