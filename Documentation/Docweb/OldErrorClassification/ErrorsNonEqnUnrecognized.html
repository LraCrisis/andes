Hannibal at 34-57</h3>
A motorcycle starts at T0 and a car starts at T1.&nbsp; Speeds of both
are constant and given.&nbsp; They pass each other at T2.&nbsp; What is
the duration of T0 to T2?&nbsp; After defining a variable for the speed
of the car from T1 to T2,&nbsp; and the speed of the motorcycle from T0
to T2, the student drew a velocity of the car from T0 to T1.&nbsp; The
velocity is unnecessary not only because it has the wrong initial time,
but because the given values are speeds, not velocities, and the problem
doesn't say that the road is straight, which would make them equal, although
the diagram draws a straight road (this should be changed).&nbsp; But the
student has already defined a variable for speed, so I have no idea what
the student is up to.
<p>The closest match is speed of the car from T1 to T2 (mismatches: speed/velocity
and T0/T1) or speed of the motorcycle (mismatches: speed/velocity and car/motorcycle).&nbsp;
But both operator applications have been done already.&nbsp; Andes should
just give up, and give next-step help.

beast at 18-25</h3>
A block is launched from a spring at T0, flies off the spring at T1 and
reaches the apex of its trajectory at T2.&nbsp; The student draws the spring
force.&nbsp; The forces approach won't work on this problem because the
spring force is not constant.&nbsp; The right pedagogy is to give Next-step
help, which is what Andes will do because it can't find a force in the
solution at all, much less one that matches the student's force. If the
student specifies NSL when choosing a PSM, the feedback should point out
that it can't be applied because one of the forces is not constant.

A block is launched from a spring at T0, flies off the spring at T1 and
reaches the apex of its trajectory at T2.&nbsp; The first action the student
makes is to define an Applied force on the spring due to the block at T0
whose name is Fw.&nbsp; Maybe the student meant to define weight but made
a couple of bad menu selections.&nbsp; Since this problem should be solved
with conservation of energy, not forces, the right pedagogy is to give
Next-step help.&nbsp; Again, Andes can't find a match.
