A car starts from rest at T0 and rolls down a frictionless 20 m driveway,
smashing into the garage door at T1.&nbsp; The student draws a zero-length
net force on the car, but the actual net force is non-zero.&nbsp; Andes2
interprets the error as an attempt to draw the non-zero net force (one
mismatch: magnitude).&nbsp; SG analysis indicates that the operator application
is not premature and not efficient.&nbsp; However, it is not an inefficiency
that Andes should point out (see <a href="../ErrorHandlers/ZeroNetForceWhenSpeedingUp.html#Karlton-Holston 35-57">discussion</a>),
basically because it is more important to get the physics right than to
learn the most efficient procedure.
<p>The operator that produces the correct net force is: "If ?body is accelerating
at time ?time in direction ?dir, then there is a net force on ?body during
?time in direction ?dir."&nbsp; Although we could just use it as the basis
for the remediation, it may be that the student is weak on this operator:&nbsp;
"If ?body is moving at time ?time in a straight line in direction ?dir
and speeding up, then it is accelerating at time ?time in direction ?dir."&nbsp;
In general, when one operator requires a proposition, and there is no evidence
that the student has applied the operator that generates the proposition,
then we need a hint sequence that covers both operator applications.
<p>Thus, the net force operator needs the following error handler is: "If
the student has drawn a zero net force on ?body at ?time, and the student
has not drawn an acceleration for ?body, but ?body is moving in a straight
line and speeding up, then hint/teach/state that when a body is moving
in a straight line and speeding up, then the body is accelerating, so there
must be a net force on the body."
<p>A KCD version of the teaching hint would go like this one:&nbsp; "Is
?body moving in a straight line and speeding up at ?time?" (Ideal Student
Answer: Yes) "Does ?body have a non-zero acceleration? (Ideal Student Answer:
Yes)&nbsp; "If a body has a non-zero acceleration, is the net force on
it zero or non-zero?"&nbsp; (Ideal student answer: zero) "But you have
drawn a zero-length net force vector.&nbsp; You should change that."
<p>Clearly, we need similar error handlers for the straight-line and the
slowing down cases, and for the circular motion case.&nbsp; We also need
similar handlers for errors where the student has drawn a zero <i>acceleration</i>
in for an object that is speeding up, slowing down or moving in a circle.

A hailstone falls 9000 meters.&nbsp; What speed does it strike the ground,
ignoring air friction?&nbsp; The student draws a non-zero vector for initial
velocity, when the vector should have zero length.&nbsp; (The Katina &amp;
LoseBerry errors occur on different problelms, but the analysis is the
same)&nbsp; The interpretation is the initial-velocity operator application
(one mismatch: magnitude), and it is not premature and on an efficient
solution path.&nbsp; So Andes must decide whether the error is due to a
slip, user interface ignorance or weak physics knowledge.&nbsp; As discussed
above, slips are unlikely for zero/non-zero vector errors, but the student
could easily be lacking user interface knowledge.
<p>Suppose the student has already drawn zero-length vectors several times,
which suggests that they are not a victim of user interface ignorance.&nbsp;
Now Andes must tutor the physics.&nbsp; The operator is, "If a ?object
is at rest at ?time, then its velocity at ?time is zero."&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
students have mastered this operator, so that is unlikely to be the cause
of the error. However, it depends on the proposition that the object is
at rest.&nbsp; The Andes KB is told that, but the actually problem statement
does not say that the hailstone was initially at rest, nor does it give
an initial velocity.&nbsp; The student has probably failed to infer that
the hailstone is initially at rest.
<p>We don't have operators for interpreting vague problem statements (and
they would be very hard to write!), but we can tutor the basic idea anyway.&nbsp;
We want students to learn that under certain circumstances, it is proper
to assume that the object starts at rest.&nbsp; Thus, an error handler
associated with the at-rest-velocity operator should be "If the student
draws non-zero velocity vector on ?body at ?time, and ?body is at rest
at ?time, and the problem does not say that the inital velocity is at rest,
then hint/teach/state that whenever a problem doesn't state a velocity
at a certain time, but it is reasonable to assume that the object is at
rest, then assume that it is at rest.&nbsp; This error classifier requires
that the problem description contain a new proposition, not-stated-explicitly(&lt;proposition>)
that can be used by this error handler and others.
<p>If the student has not drawn zero-length vectors several times, then
we need to ask if the initial velocity of the hailstone is zero or not.&nbsp;
If the student says it is zero, then we launch the training card on how
to draw zero-length vectors.&nbsp; If the student says anything else (e.g,.
non-zero, I dont' know, etc.) then we treat it as above.

A soap box derby car starts with initial velocity of 1.00 m/s and accelerates
to 15.0 m/s over 62.0 seconds.&nbsp; What is its average acceleration?&nbsp;
The student draws a zero-length initial velocity; it should be non-zero.&nbsp;
Andes interprets this as an failed attempt to apply the given-velocity
operator (one mismatch: magnitude), which is efficient and not premature.&nbsp;
Slips are unlikely with zero/non-zero vector errors, and user interface
misunderstandings are unlikely with zero-length vectors.&nbsp; So it must
be weak physics knowledge that caused the error.
<p>Since the operator is another trivial one, the failure probably lies
in the interpretation of the problem statement, which supplies the proposition
that is simply given to the Andes KB as part of the problem description.&nbsp;
Thus, we need an error handler for the operator that says: "If the student
draws a zero velocity for ?body at ?time, then the first hint is 'Is ?body
at rest at ?time?'" followed by "Reread the problem statement.&nbsp; It
gives a velocity for ?body at ?time." followed by "You need to draw a non-zero
vector for the velocity of ?body at ?time."
<p>In this case, the KCD version of the teaching hint should say something
like, "Is ?body at rest at ?time?" (Ideal expected answer is No but if
the answer is Yes, then suggest that the student reread the problem statement)&nbsp;
"If the body is not at rest, then is its velocity zero or no zero?"&nbsp;
(Ideal expected answer: Zero).&nbsp; "But you have drawn a zero-length
vector for ?velocity.&nbsp; You should change it."

How long did it take the Blackbird to cover 1000 km at an average speed
of 935 m/s?&nbsp; The student solved the problem correctly, but drew a
body for T0, the starting time.&nbsp; Andes choose the operator application
that draws a body for the time interval&nbsp; T0 to T1 (one mismatch: time).
<p>Normally, selecting a wrong time for a body would be handled by next-step
help, but the student has already completed the PSM in this case so giving
next-step help doesn't make sense.&nbsp; This student apparently thinks
of the body tool as just drawing a dot, and doesn't realize that it should
also define the time interval for the PSM.&nbsp; Thus, we need an error
handler on the draw-body operator that checks if the PSM is completed:
"If this PSM is completed, then just to teach/state that the body should
be defined for the time interval over which the PSM was or will be applied."

A bullet leaves the gun at T0, hits the gong at T1 and the sound reaches
the shooter at T2.&nbsp; The student defines a variables named "vsound"
for the average speed of the <i>target</i> from T1 to T2.&nbsp; Clearly
just a slip.
<p>Andes should choose the op app that draws the velocity of the sound
from T1 to T2 (one mismatche: body).&nbsp; It should have an error handler
that detects a slip: "If the student's choice of body is ?object, and ?object
is not moving, then point/state that ?object is not moving."
<p>The same slip handler is needed on many operators.&nbsp; It would be
nice if it could be inherited, but that would require a major restructing
of the KB.

A person pushes a 10 kg shopping cart at constant speed with a force of
100 N acting down at 45 degrees.&nbsp; What is the value [sic] of the friction
force acting horizontally on the cart?&nbsp; What is the normal force exerted
by the ground on the cart?&nbsp; The student has entered correct answers
for both sought quantities.&nbsp; He has also drawn a correct applied force
and defined correct variables for the weight, normal and kinetic friction
force.&nbsp; His calculations for the normal force direction are done correctly,
but the calculations for the normal force magnitude are syntactically ill-formed
(he probably did the calculations on paper).&nbsp; The student has also
drawn a static friction force on the cart due to the ground that points
straight up.&nbsp; There is no such force, and the student is asking why
it is wrong.
<p>One possibility, which we could check by examining the log files, is
that the student tried to draw the normal force, and Andes wouldn't let
him because it was defined already (and named F3), so he tried to draw
it as a static friction force instead (named F4).&nbsp; This can't happen
with the Andes 2 user interface, because students must draw the vector;
they can no longer define variables for them.&nbsp; So let us assume that
the student is not intending to draw a normal force, but actually intended
to draw the force that he did draw, and build an error handler for that
case, which may someday occur.
<p>The student has probably gotten normal force and static friction confused.&nbsp;
Although there is only one force between the ground and the cart and it
is at a diagonal, physicists always treat it as two forces: one perpendicular
to the surface (called the normal force or reaction force) and the other
parallel to the surface (called the friction force).&nbsp; It may be that
the student knows that there is a vertical force here and that it is related
to the friction force, but doesn't realize that it is called "normal force."
He thinks it is called "static friction force."
<p>Andes2 needs to interpret the static friction force drawn straight up.&nbsp;
It's candidates via syntactic matching are a kinetic friction force that
is horizontal (two mismatches: static/kinetic and vertical/horizontal)
and a normal force (one mismatch: static friction/ normal).&nbsp; The kinetic
friction force is already drawn, so that candidate is eliminated.&nbsp;
Thus, Andes chooses the normal force as its interpretation of the student's
error.&nbsp; The normal force operator application is efficient and not
premature.&nbsp; No slip or user interface heuristics interfere with the
conclusion that the student is weak on this operator.&nbsp; The normal
force operator definition contains the error handler: "If there is a friction
force on ?body at ?time due to ?surface, then point/teach/state that whenever
a surface interacts with an object, there is both a normal force and a
friction force on the object.&nbsp; The friction force will be zero if
the contact is assumed to be frictionless, and thus can be ignored.&nbsp;
Otherwise, it will either be a static friction if the object is not moving
relative to the surface, or a dynamic friction force if the object is moving
relative to the surface.&nbsp; That is, there are always 2 forces: the
normal force, and a friction force that is either zero, static or dynamic."

Ingpole at 6-43</h3>
A 90 kg parachutist jumps from a plane at T0, hits the snow at T1 at 20
m/s and stops at the bottom of a 1 m deep crater at T2.&nbsp; What is the
average net force that acted on him as he plowed into the snow?&nbsp; The
student drew a correct acceleration for T1 to T2, initial velocity at T1,
and a downward non-zero net force vector for time T2.&nbsp; The net force
is non-zero before T2 and zero afterwards, but it is not clear what it
is right at T2.&nbsp; Moreover, the problem does not require this net force
in order to be solved.&nbsp; However, the problem does require the net
force from T1 to T2.&nbsp; That's the sought quantity in fact.&nbsp; One
remediation is just to give next-step help.&nbsp; That will simply ask
the person what quantity is sought, and coach him/her until&nbsp; he/she
selects the right net force.&nbsp; Another is to treat this as a slip on
the time specification and a confusion about which direction the net force
points.
<p>Andes matches the student entry to the net force from T1 to T2 (mismatches:
time, direction).&nbsp; If the match is good enough (according to some
threshold to be determined), it accepts the interpretation (otherwise the
student get's next step help).&nbsp; The op app is efficient and not premature.&nbsp;
It has an error handler for the direction, but not for the time specifier.&nbsp;
Since it can't talk about the direction until the time specifier is correct
(need a way to represent that in the KB), it decides to give a hint on
the time specifier error as a slip: "Check the time."&nbsp; If the student
fixes the time specification, and asks what's wrong again, then Andes will
find the error handler for net-force direction: "If the acceleration of
?body has been drawn, then hint/teach/state that the net force is in the
same direction as the acceleration."

Cougar at 5-39</h3>
How high does a firecracker go when it is hurled at a speed of 20 m/s at
an angle of 60 degrees?&nbsp; The student defined variables for initial
velocity, duration and displacement, then drew coordinate axes tilted 60
degrees.&nbsp; The student's basic approach should be to apply kinematics
along the vertical axis, not a tilted one.&nbsp; Andes should go through
the preamble up to the point where the PSM has been completely identified,
then give a hint sequence.
<p>Andes matches the student's entry to the standard axes (one mismatch:
rotation).&nbsp; The op ap is efficient and not premature (here I'm assuming
that the student draws the velocity and displacement instead of defining
variables for them).&nbsp; It's not likely to be a slip or user interface
ignorance.&nbsp; Andes consults the error handlers for the axis drawing
operator that handles the projectile motion PSM.&nbsp; The error handler
says to do the preamble, then hint/teach/state that whenever one is applying
the projectile motion method, the axes should be in standard orientation.

At time T0, a firecracker is hurled with given initial velocity at a 60
degree angle.&nbsp; How high is it when it explodes 2 seconds later?&nbsp;
The student drew a body and initial velocity, then defined a variable for
the acceleration at time T0.&nbsp; The problem actually involves the average
acceleration over T0 to T1, which is the same as a_y which is the same
as g.
<p>Andes matches the student entry to acceleration over the T0 to T1 (one
mismatch: time).&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator application is efficient and
not premature.&nbsp; The error doesn't seem to be a slip or user interface
ignorance.&nbsp; Thus, Andes consults the operator that draws acceleration,
which has this error handler: "If the student has drawn an acceleration
with a different time specifier, then play the preamble up to the point
where the current PSM is selected (this establishes the appropriate time),
then teach/state that for &lt;name of PSM> methods, the acceleration's
time specifier should be the same as the whole method."

On the bullet-gong problem, the student defined the bullet as the body
at time T0. It should be defined over the time interval T0 to T1.&nbsp;
This is best handled with a preamble, because the student has to see that
the plan is to apply kinematics over the time interval, and that is why
the body is defined over the time interval. (That would also take care
of a second problem that this student has, which is that she has defined
a variable for the speed of sound over T0 to T1, and that variable is unnecessary.
I don't know why Andes 1 marked that variable correct.)
<p>Andes matches the student's entry to the op ap that draws a body over
the time interval T0 to T1 (one mismatch: time).&nbsp; The op ap is efficient
and not premature.&nbsp; The hint associated with it runs the preamble,
which is a bit lengthy.&nbsp; Andes asks for the sought (distance to target)
and the method (speed-distance-duration).&nbsp; However, when Andes asks
for the body and time of the method, the student can go either for bullet
during T0 to T1 or sound during T1 to T2.&nbsp; Hopefully, the student
chooses the bullet, because then Andes can fire its hint about drawing
the body for the whole time interval.&nbsp; If the student chooses the
sound instead, then that hint sequence will never get a chance to apply,
because the student will have to draw the other body first.&nbsp; Thus,
the error handler in this case should just say to run next-step help, period.

A 90 kg parachutist jumps from a plane at T0, hits the snow at 20 m/s at
T1, and comes to rest at T2 at the bottom on a 1 m crater.&nbsp; What average
net force acted on him as he made the crater?&nbsp; The student's first
action is to define a variable for the duration from T0 to T1.&nbsp; This
is not needed, as kinematics can be applied to T1 to T2 directly, because
the velocity at T1 is given.&nbsp; The right pedagogy is to give Next-step
help.
<p>Andes matches this to the op application that defines a duration for
T1 to T2 (one mismatch: time).&nbsp; The op is efficient and not premature.&nbsp;
The error handler says to run next-step help.
