<h2>
Restoring omitted forces in a sum of forces</h2></center>

<center>(as of 2/23/01)</center>

<p>This perturbation of the equation is a bit tricky.&nbsp; Andes should
search the equation for sums containing either force magnitudes, force
components, or muliplications that contain a force magnitude and a trig
function.&nbsp; It is OK for the sum to contain addends that are not such
force terms (e.g., Fn_x+m*a_x=0 is okay).&nbsp;&nbsp; As a special case,
it should also consider an equation whose left or right side consists of
a single force magnitude, force component or multiplication of a force
magnitude and a trig function.&nbsp; It will treat this special case as
a "singleton sum."&nbsp; I don't think it is necessary to search for "singleton
sums" inside multiplications or other algebraic expressions.
<p>Having found a candidate sum, Andes tries putting force components into
the sum and checking the equation via color-by-numbers.&nbsp; It should
probably also try putting negated force components into the sum.&nbsp;
I think we need not try other force-denoting expressions (e.g., magnitudes
or projection expressions) if we try both positive and negative force components.
<h3>
molson Eq-USNA 51-03</h3>
If a car is racing around a 400 m radius circular track that is banked
at 20 degrees, what velocity should it travel so that there is no friction?&nbsp;
The student draws axes rotated 200 degrees, both weight and normal forces,
but no acceleration.&nbsp; The student defines a variable for acceleration
instead.&nbsp; Then the student enters a_x=a*cos(20) which is correct and
suggests that the student didn't need to draw the acceleration in order
to understand its direction.&nbsp; The student then enters “Fn_x=mcar*a_x”
which is incorrect because the student has dropped Fw_x, which is nonzero,
from the sum of forces on the left side of the equation.
<ul>
<li>
IH notices that the student is not including all forces and directs student
to notice the missing force and then has student all the forces.</li>

<li>
RO also notices student is missing a force and uses “Fw_x + Fn_x = m*a_x”
and “a_x=v^2/r” to assist the student.</li>

<li>
Andes fails to identify the equation the student was trying to enter. It
identified “Fw_total” instead of “Fn_x”</li>

<li>
KVL: You’ve left a force out.</li>
</ul>
Andes can diagnose the error by adding force components to create a sum
of forces on the left side.&nbsp; When it adds in Fw_x, it gets a correct,
primitive equation that is premature because acceleration has not been
drawn.&nbsp; Andes thus says, "You need to add acceleration&nbsp; to your
diagram before writting equations."&nbsp; Suppose the student does that
then asks again why this equation is red.&nbsp; Now Andes finds that the
equation is not premature, and it decides that the student probably knowns
NSL, so it adopts the slip hypothesis.&nbsp; It says, "You left a force
out of the sum of forces." then "You should add Fw_x, the weight of the
car, into your sum of forces."
<h3>
<a NAME="a5 3-43"></a>a5 Eq-Pitt 3-43</h3>
On the shopping cart problem, the student draws a complete FBD, enters
givens, a=0, all projections of forces on the x-axis, then S_x=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x,
where S is an undefined variable.&nbsp; The closest matching equation is
0=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x+Fk_x, which includes Fk_x, the x-component of the kinetic
friction force, and excludes S_x, which is undefined.
<ul>
<li>
T1 thinks S_x denotes net force, and that the student should have left
out the normal and weight forces.&nbsp; Although the student has drawn
the normal and weight forces correctly, and the student has written Fn_x=0
and Fw_x=0, T1 still asks the student what their directions are.</li>

<li>
T2 says to put components of all forces in the equation.</li>

<li>
Andes says, "You have not defined the variable S."</li>

<li>
KVL: Maybe S_x denotes the friction force, as that is the only force on
the left side of the body, and students sometimes use &lt;left forces>
= &lt;right forces> for N1L.&nbsp; Andes should first complain about the
undefined variable, then react to the revised equation.</li>
</ul>
If the student changes the S_x to Fk_x, gets red, and asks for help, then
we have a sign error, which is discussed <a href="ErrorsEqnSign.html#a5 3-43">elsewhere</a>.&nbsp;
On the other hand, if the student defines S as the net force, then we have
a missing force.&nbsp; To diagnosis it, Andes needs to insert force components
into the sum on the right side of the equation until the equation becomes
correct.&nbsp; This yields a correct, primitive, non-premature equation.&nbsp;
Because the omitted force has been drawn (the equation would be premature
otherwise),&nbsp; this is most likely a slip, so Andes just says, "You
left a force out of the sum of forces." then "You left Ff_x, the kinetic
friction force on the cart, out of the sum of forces."
<h3>
Midn-N-Smith Eq-USNA 34-16</h3>
In the shopping cart problem, there are 4 forces: weight, normal, pushing
and kinetic friction.&nbsp; The student draws two of these forces, pushing
and weight, but leaves out the normal and friction forces.&nbsp; The student
defines a variable Fn for the net force, and writes “Fn_y = Fw_y + Fp_y”
which is also missing the normal and friction force.&nbsp; The student
had earlier written several projection equations as well.
<ul>
<li>
IH has the student to predict the acceleration given the drawn forces,
points out the contradiction, and suggests that forces are missing from
the diagram.</li>

<li>
RO also notes the missing forces and also asks student to reconsider forces
acting on cart.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Maybe you should also include a term for the magnitude of
the normal force on the cart due to the ground in this equation.”</li>

<li>
KVL: You need to complete your fbd before entering equations.</li>
</ul>
When the student writes the projection equations, Andes would complain
that the FBD was not complete.&nbsp; But suppose that the student hasn't
written the projections first, but wrote the sum-of-forces equation first.&nbsp;
Then Andes would need to plug in two forces into the sum before discovering
that the underlying equation was primitive and premature.&nbsp; This would
allow it to say, "You should finish drawing forces before entering any
equations."
<h3>
<a NAME="ambiguous inter"></a>022396 Eq-USNA 19-04</h3>
In the problem where there is a person is pushing a shopping cart, the
student defines variables, draws a correct FBD, enters many equations,
then enters “Fp_x=F_x” where Fp is the pushing force and F is the net force.&nbsp;
The closest matching equation is either Fp_x+Ff_x = F_x (which was written
correctly earlier as equation 17) or Fp_x=-Ff_x, where Ff is the friction
force.&nbsp;&nbsp; The immediately preceding equation (20) is F_x=0.
<ul>
<li>
IH thinks the correct equation as “Fp_x + Ff_x = F_x” and asks the student
to reconcile it with equations 17 and 20.</li>

<li>
RO thinks the correct equation is Fp_x=-Ff_x, so treats it as an algebraic
slip.</li>

<li>
Andes identifies correct equation as a form of the one IH noted and says,
“Maybe you should also include a term for ‘Ff_x’ in this equation.”</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find RO’s interpretation more likely.&nbsp; The
student combined F_x=0 with Fp_x+Ff_x=F_x, then dropped the negative sign
and the “f” from -Ff_x.&nbsp; The closest matching equation according to
Andes will probably be equation 17, which has been entered already.&nbsp;
In such a case, Andes should infer that the student has probably tried
to do an algebraic manipulation and blown it.&nbsp; Simply telling the
student, “You appear to have made an algebraic manipulation error.” is
probably not helpful enough, but it would be easy to implement.&nbsp; A
better solution is to ask the student, via a justification, what equations
were combined algebraically to generate this one.&nbsp; In this case, the
student should enter 17 and 20.&nbsp; Andes would then say, “They combine
to form Fp_x+Ff_x=0.”</li>
</ul>
Andes2 can find two interpretations of this error.&nbsp; It can put forces
into the sum until it discovers the Fp_x+Ff_x = F_x interpretation, which
is compound (it uses Fp_x+Ff_x+Fn_x+Fw_x= F_x,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fn_x=0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and&nbsp;&nbsp; Fw_x=0) and not premature.&nbsp; It can combine a negative
sign insertion with substituting Ff_x for F_x, and thus discover the Fp_x=-Ff_x
interpretation, which is also compound (it uses the same equations as the
other interpretation and F_x=0)&nbsp; and not premature.&nbsp; All the
primitive components of both interpretations have been entered already.&nbsp;
Thus, no matter what interpretation Andes2 picks, the first hint is the
same: "Check your algebraic manipulations."&nbsp; The bottom-out hint would
be different.&nbsp; Probably doesn't matter much bottom-out hint is given.&nbsp;
Thus, it wouldn't hurt if Andes merely guessed one of the two interpretations
in this case.&nbsp; Since the first interpretation has one perturbation
(adding Ff_x) whereas the other has two (sign; subst), Andes should probably
choose the first interpretation.
