<h2>
Errors where student confused one variable for another</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/22/01)</center>

<p>These errors can be uncovered by substituting a correct quantity for
a similar student quantity.&nbsp; These errors are often caused by slips,
rather than by ignorance of the target equation.&nbsp; Thus, Andes must
decide, based on apparently trivial features such as the names of the variables,
whether to give a hint based on the slip hypothesis or the ignorance hypothesis.
<h3>
<a NAME="Ingpole 28-31"></a>Ingpole Eq-USNA 28-31</h3>
In the problem where the car is rolling down the driveway towards the garage,
the student defines variables, draws a correct FBD including both forces
and all kinematics vectors, applies NSL in one line to get a value for
acceleration, then enters “vf_x^2=-2*a(d).”&nbsp; The target equation is
vf_x^2=-2*a(-d).&nbsp; The student has dropped the negative sign on d.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the student has also defined vf as the average velocity
from T0 to T1 instead of the velocity at T1.&nbsp; The tutors and the student
didn’t notice this mistake because Andes marked the variable definition
green, which is what it should do, because average velocity can be used
in some kinematics solution to the problem.&nbsp; Thus, there are two errors:
a missing negation and a variable confusion.
<ul>
<li>
IH first asks how the student relates a to a_x, then asks how the student
relates d to d_x.</li>

<li>
RO asks what the direction of d is (despite the fact that d is drawn),
then points out the correct equation.</li>

<li>
Andes1 says that vf_x is not a relevant quantity.</li>

<li>
KVL: The first thing to remedy is to get the student to rewrite the equation
in component form.&nbsp; Assuming she does that, Andes should say, “vf_x
stands for the average velocity from T0 to T1.&nbsp; Is that what you want
here?”</li>
</ul>
Andes2 should find that substituting the final velocity's x-component for
vf_x and negating the right side of the equation produces a correct equation.&nbsp;
Indy analysis finds that it is a compound of vf_x^2 = vi_x^2 + 2*a_x*d_x,&nbsp;&nbsp;
vi_x=0,&nbsp;&nbsp; a_x=-a,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; d_x=-d.&nbsp; SG analysis
shows that the student's equation is premature, and the equation should
be written first in component form without the substitutions.
<p>Suppose Andes says to do that, and the student changes the equation
to vf_x^2 = vi_x^2 + 2*a_x*d_x. This equation will be marked red, so suppose
the student asks what's wrong with it.&nbsp; Andes finds that substituting
the final velocity's x-component for vf_x produces a correct equation.&nbsp;
Indy analysis finds that it is primitive.&nbsp; SG analysis finds that
it is not premature.&nbsp; Now Andes must decide whether the student intended
to put the average velocity in the equation, and thus needs to be taught
a correct version of the equation, or whether the student intended to define
the final velocity and put it in the equation, but slipped.&nbsp; Even
without knowing this student, it seems likely that the student slipped,
because the student chose vf as the variable's name.&nbsp; I think it would
be worth including some typical names in the Defexprs for quantities so
that Andes can be as smart as humans.&nbsp; Given this info, Andes would
decide that the student slipped, and thus give hint sequence based on the
substitution: "Check your definition of vf." then "You have used vf as
if it were the velocity of the car at T1, but you defined it as the average
velocity of the car from T0 to T1." then "Redefine vf by clicking on it
with the right moust button.&nbsp; Change it to be the velocity of the
car at T1."

<a NAME="seth 8-13"></a>seth Eq-USNA 8-13</h3>
If a 100 kg person slides down a rope that will hold only 500N, what is
his minimum acceleration? The student defined variables, drew a body and
axes with +X straight up, and entered “F_y = 500” where F is the friction
force.&nbsp; The closest matching equation is F_x=500.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes “F_x = 500 N” as student’s intended equation and points out definition
of axes to student.</li>

<li>
RO notes “F_y = 0N” as student’s intended equation and also points out
definition of axes to student.</li>

<li>
Andes gives no equation and explains that F_y is an unknown value for Andes
and thus will be marked incorrect anywhere.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should first ask the student to draw forces, then say, “F_y
is the y-component of the friction force.&nbsp; Is that really what you
want here?”</li>
</ul>
Andes substitutes all forces for F_y and finds that using F_x makes the
equation correct.&nbsp; Indy analysis finds that it is a cmpound of F_x=F
and F=500 (this assumes that the problem statement is interpreted to make
the friction force be 500; that's the whole trick with this problem, and
we don't have an easy way to represent it in the KB).&nbsp; SG analysis
finds that the student needs to draw forces first, so Andes says to do
that.
<p>Suppose the student draws the fbd then asks again why F_y=500 is wrong.&nbsp;
Andes retrieves the interpretation, and SG analysis says that it has a
given value substituted into it prematurely, so Andes says that.
<p>Suppose the student changes the equation to F_y=F and&nbsp; again asks
what's wrong.&nbsp; Andes retrieves the interpretation, and now SG analysis
is happy.&nbsp; Now Andes must decide whether to tutor the student on the
projection equation for the vertical axis, or whether the student slipped
and used the wrong variable.&nbsp; Even without knowing anything about
the student, it is clear to the human tutors that the student slipped.&nbsp;
This is because the student used a non-standard rotation for the axes,
and because F_y would be the right name for the variable is the axes were
in their standard orientation.&nbsp; The error handler should be: "If substituting
one component variable for another component variable of the same vector
makes the equation correct, but the student's variable would be correct
if the axes were in their standard rotation, then say, "Your axes are not
in the standard orientation.&nbsp; Is &lt;student's variable> what you
want here?" then say "Because your axes are rotated, you need to use &lt;correct
variable> instead of &lt;student variable>."
<h3>
<a NAME="a5 48-43"></a>a5 Eq-Pitt 48-43</h3>
On the ring pulled by 3 forces, the student has drawn a FBD without acceleration,
entered givens, entered projection equations for all 3 forces, and written
"FS3=Ft1_x+Ft2_x+Ft3_x."&nbsp; This would be correct if (a) FS3 were defined
as the net force and (b) its x-component were used here instead of its
magnitude.
<ul>
<li>
T1 asks what is the sum of forces.</li>

<li>
T2 asks the student to define a variable for the net force, then to use
its x-component in this equation.</li>

<li>
Andes says that the FS3 is not defined.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should first say that FS3 is not defined, then it should tutor
the student on the sum-of-forces principle.</li>
</ul>
Andes first gives an undefined variable message, so let's assume that the
student defines FS as the net force, reenters the equation, gets red, and
asks for help.&nbsp; Andes substitutes various force-related quantities
for FS until it finds that FS_x=Ft1_x+Ft2_x+Ft3_x is correct.&nbsp; Indy
analysis indicates that it is a primitive equation.&nbsp; The equation
is not premature nor inefficient.&nbsp; Now Andes has to decide whether
the student needs tutoring on the equation or the substitution.&nbsp; There
are no heuristics suggesting that the slip is likely, so Andes should decide
to tutor on the operator application that generated the correct equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Andes uses the hint sequence that it retrieves from the operator.&nbsp;
It starts with the goal assumption, "I assume you are writing Newton's
second law in component form."&nbsp; and gives the pointing hint, "It mentions
the x-components of the net force and all the individual forces."&nbsp;
The teaching hint and the bottom-out hint follow.
<h3>
023300 Eq-USNA 22-52</h3>
In the problem where a bullet is fired and hits a gong, the student defined
variables, drew a body and axes, defined t as the duration from T1 to T2,
then entered "t = 0.731" where 0.731 is the given value for the duration
from T0 to T2.&nbsp; The student has not defined a variable for the duration
from T0 to T2.
<ul>
<li>
IH asks for definition of t, then points out that 0.731 is for a different
time interval.</li>

<li>
RO asks for definition of t, then points out that 0.731 is for a different
time interval.</li>

<li>
Andes1 just questions value of 't' that the student entered. The correct
equation that Andes identifies is 't = 0.606s", which is the correct value
for t, but it would take lots of calculation to derive it.</li>

<li>
KVL: The problem says, "...and hears the sound .731 seconds later" which
is linguistically ambigous between T0 to T2 and T1 to T2.&nbsp; However,
thinking about how the shooter would measure the elapsed time suggests
that he would find it more convenient to start the timer when he fires
the gun rather than when he sees the little tiny bullet strike the target
a long ways away.&nbsp; Thus, "experimenters' common sense" suggests the
T0 to T2 interpretation.&nbsp; None of this reasoning is particularly relevant
to physics, so the problem should be changed to remove this ambiguity (msg
sent to Anders 3/22/01).&nbsp; In the meantime, we can treat this as a
slip, because there is certainly no reason to teach the operator applicatino
that writes this given.</li>
</ul>
Andes tries substituting various correct durations for t until it finds
that t02 makes the equation correct.&nbsp; Indy analysis finds that t02=0.731
is primitive, and SG analysis says that it is not premature.&nbsp; The
operator application for writing the given has no hint sequence, so Andes
must treat this as a slip.&nbsp; The hint sequence is, "Check the times
used in the definition of t." then "You defined t to be the duration of
T1 to T2, but your equation should have the duration of T0 to T2."&nbsp;
then "Redefine t to be the duration of T0 to T2."
<h3>
brody Eq-USNA 49-11</h3>
If a 100 kg person slides down a rope that will support only 500N, what
is his minimal acceleration? The student defined variables, drew a correct
FBD, entered several equations, then entered “F_y=500” where F is the net
force on the person.&nbsp;&nbsp; The closest matching equation is Ff_y
= 500, where Ff is the student's variable for friction force. This equation
has not been written before.
<ul>
<li>
IH asks what’s the relation between the tension in the rope and the friction
force. She is trying to get the student to infer that Ff_y = 500.</li>

<li>
RO asks for the definition of F_y and of the 500 N.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Do you want to use ‘F’ rather than the value of ‘Ff’?”</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should say something like, “F is the net force.&nbsp; What is
500 N?”</li>
</ul>
Andes substitutes various force quantities for F_y until it finds that
Ff_y makes the equation correct.&nbsp; Indy analysis shows that Ff_y=500
is primitive, and SG analysis finds that it is not premature. There is
no hint sequence for the operator application that writes the given equation
Ff_y=500, so Andes must treat it as a slip.&nbsp; The hint sequence is,
"Check your definition of F_y."&nbsp; then "You have defined F_y to be
the y-component of the net force on the person, but your equation should
have the y-component of the friction force on the person instead." then
"Use Ff_y instead of F_y."
<h3>
Chris Eq-USNA 43-39</h3>
In the problem of a block on a spring, the student defines variables, draws
a body, and enters "U0 = mbgh."&nbsp; The target equations are U0=mb*g*(-d)
where d is compression of the spring, or U2 = mb*g*h where h is the height
of the block at its apex.&nbsp; U0 and U2 are the PE at times T0 and T2,
respectively.&nbsp; Thus, the student has either used U0 instead of U2
or has use h instead of –d.
<ul>
<li>
IH complains about the use of implicit multiplication, then points out
that at T0, the block will be lower than the zero point of gravitational
PE.</li>

<li>
RO says, "U0 is the PE at T0.&nbsp; h is the height of the block at T2."</li>

<li>
Andes suggests using PE at T2 rather than PE at T0.</li>

<li>
KVL: The justifications for these two equations are nearly the same—only
the time points differ.&nbsp; Thus, asking for a justification may not
disambiguate these two.</li>
</ul>
Andes can find the second interpretation by replacing the students U0 with
U2, which yields a correct, primitive, non-premature equation that Andes
should hint.&nbsp; It can't find the other interpretation, but even if
it could, it would reject it because it is a compound equation, and thus
less likely.
<h3>
ronjon21 Eq-USNA 31-18</h3>
In the problem where the aircraft carrier plows into a pier, the student
defined variables, drew a FBD without acceleration, then entered "vf_x
= v_x + a*t" as the first equation.&nbsp; The target equation has -a instead
of a or a_x instead of a.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes a sign error and questions the direction of 'a_x' and has student
explain what is happening physically with the equation the student entered.</li>

<li>
RO asks, "what is the direction of a_x?"</li>

<li>
Andes suggestions checking signs.</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp; Andes should say, “You can prevent errors like this by always
drawing acceleration and other relevant vectors on the FBD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the student asks it to explain further, it can say, “Please draw the
acceleration.”</li>
</ul>
Substituting a_x for a creates a correct, primitive equation and is thus
preferred.&nbsp; Inserting the negative sign creates a correct, compound
equation.
<h3>
bee Eq-USNA 8-29</h3>
In the problem where a person is hanging onto a rope over a cliff, the
student defines variables, draws axes and a body but no forces or acceleration,
then enters "Fw_y = F + Fn" where Fw is weight, F is friction and Fn is
the net force.&nbsp; The target equation has -Fn or Fn_y for Fn.
<ul>
<li>
IH has student draw forces, then write projections, then rewrite the target
equation.</li>

<li>
RO has student draw forces including the net force, then asks about direction
of Fn, then rewrite the target equation.</li>

<li>
Andes says to check signs.</li>

<li>
KVL: (The student appears to be putting the downward vector on the left
side of the equation and the upward vectors on the right side.&nbsp; That
works for N1L but not for N2L, and it only works for N1L if you use magnitudes
and not a mix of components and magnitudes.&nbsp; That’s why we don’t want
students using this trick.)&nbsp; Andes says, “You should draw forces before
entering equations.”</li>
</ul>
The substitution and negation diagnoses both yield correct, compound equations,
but the substitution interpretation has less cognitive load.&nbsp; Both
are premature, so it doesn't matter.&nbsp; Andes tells the student to draw
forces.&nbsp; Assuming the student does and asks for help again, s/he gets
another nudge to enter the component equation.&nbsp; That probably takes
care of the sign error.
<h3>
LoseBerry Eq-USNA 9-24</h3>
In the problem where a car is rolling down a driveway towards a garage
door, the student defines variables, draws an FBD without weight, enters
equations, then enters “vf^2 = vi^2 + 2*ag_x*(dc).”&nbsp; The closest matching
equation has –dc instead of dc.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes a sign error and questions definition of dc(_x) and notes equation:
“vf_x^2 = vi_x^2 + 2*a*g_x*dc_x”.</li>

<li>
RO also notes sign error and also questions definition of dc_x and points
out same equation that IH pointed out.</li>

<li>
Andes also notes sign error.</li>

<li>
KVL: Since dc is drawn, Andes should say, “Try writing the equation in
textbook, component form (i.e., no magnitudes; use only variables for components
instead).”</li>
</ul>
Andes can diagnosis via substitution or negation insertion.&nbsp; Both
yield compound equations, but the substituion interpretation has lower
cognitive load and is preferred.
<h3>
lewiston Eq-USNA 10-23</h3>
In the problem of the supertanker, the student defines variables, draws
a body and axes, then enters “d=(vti*t)+(.5*a*t^2).”&nbsp; The target equation
has –a instead of a.
<ul>
<li>
IH asks the student to draw the acceleration.</li>

<li>
RO asks for the direction of ‘a’.</li>

<li>
Andes also notes the sign error</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should ask the student to draw the acceleration.</li>
</ul>
The usual competition between negation insertion and substitution.
<h3>
Shrike Eq-USNA 5-52</h3>
In the problem where a bullet is fired and hits a gong, after defining
variables (no FBD), the student entered "2s=(vb*T1)+(vs*T2)" as the first
equation.&nbsp; The target equation has s1 instead of s (s is undefined),
T1-T0 instead of T1 and T2-T1 instead of T2.
<ul>
<li>
IH points out that student meant s1 instead of s.&nbsp; Then IH asks student
to express "t" (presumably, the length of time between the firing the bullet
and hearing the sound) in terms of T0, T1 and T2.</li>

<li>
RO says, "you don't know T1 and T2.&nbsp; You only know the differences
between time points, such as T2-T0=0.731."</li>

<li>
Andes points out that there are no values for T1 and T2 and thus any equation
with these variables will be marked as incorrect.</li>

<li>
KVL: Since this is a speed-distance-duration problem and not kinematics,
the student doesn't have to draw vectors and axes first.&nbsp; Thus, Andes
should just teach the use of time points.</li>
</ul>
Let's assume the student has corrected the undefined variable and asked
what's wrong again.&nbsp; Andes notes that the equation has time points
in it, so it tries substituting durations for the time points until it
finds that 2*s=(vb*t01)+(vs*t12) is a correct equation.&nbsp; Indy analysis
finds that it is a compound of s1=vb*t01 and s1=vs*t12.&nbsp; SG analysis
indicates that they are not premature.&nbsp; Andes thus has to decide between
teaching the target equations or a slip interpretation.&nbsp; The use of
time points instead of intervals is marked as a highly likely slip, and
it comes with a training card hint (e.g,.&nbsp; “Time points stand for
specific clock times, such as January 1, 2000, 9:34 am.&nbsp; To express
the duration of a time interval, you should define a duration variable.
Although you can also express a duration by subtracting two time points
(e.g., T1-T0), this can lead to messier equations.”), so Andes gives that.
