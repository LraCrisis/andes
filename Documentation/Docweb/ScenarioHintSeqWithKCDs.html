<h2>
An example of hint sequences that contain KCDs</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/16/01)</center>

<p>We want to run experiments contrasting KCDS to non-interactive hints,
namely string and minilesson hints.&nbsp; Thus, we need the Hints slot
to contain both KCDS, minilessons and string hints that cover the same
topic, and we need to have Andes 2 ignore some of these depending on the
settings of a switch.&nbsp; The basic ideas is that if two members of a
hint sequence have the same function, then they are interchangeable.&nbsp;
Thus, if there is a String hint and a KCD hint whose functions fields have
the same set of atoms in them, then depending on how a switch is set, either
one or the other will be ignored.
<p>Also, if two hints in the same hint sequence have the same function,
then only one will be shown per dialog.&nbsp; The code should prefer hints
that have not yet been presented.&nbsp; If there are ties, it uses the
order in the hint sequence to break them.
<p>For instance, suppose the hint sequence is
<p>(string (point) "Think about the direction of ~a." (?force))
<br>(kcd (teach) "Normal-force-direction-via-atomic-level" NIL)
<br>(kcd (teach) "Normal-force-direction-via-third-law" NIL)
<br>(minilesson (teach) "NormalForceDir.html" NIL)
<br>(string (teach) "The normal force is always directed perpendicular
to the surface." NIL)
<br>(string (bottom-out) "~a it should be perpendicular to ~a, namely,
~a."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (?force
?surface ?direction))
<p>This is a hint sequence for the bug where normal forces that are drawn
straight up instead of perpendicular to the surface.&nbsp; Now the usual
sequence for hints is goal, point, teach and bottom-out.&nbsp; This hint
lacks a goal hint, which is typical of hint sequences associated with bugs.&nbsp;
The first time that the student exhibits this bug, and the switch allows
showing both KCDs and non-KCDs, then the student will get the first get
"Think about the direction of the normal force on the car."&nbsp; If the
student clicks on Explain-more, then they student will get the KCD called
normal-force-direction-via-atomic-level.&nbsp; When that KCD ends, if the
student again clicks on Explain more, the workbench shows the bottom-out
hint, "The normal force on the car should be perpendicular to the driveway,
namely, 125 degrees."&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the end of this dialog.&nbsp;
If the student exhibits the bug again, then the same thing happens except
that the other KCD is played instead.&nbsp; On the third occurence of the
bug, the student gets the minilesson.&nbsp; On the fourth occurence, the
student gets the string hint, "The normal force is always directed perpendicular
to the surface."&nbsp;&nbsp; On subsequent occurrences, all four teaching
hints are tied, so Andes repeatedly selects the first one.&nbsp; If the
switch is set to avoid KCDs, then on the first occurrence of the bug, the
minilesson will be shown as the teaching hint.&nbsp; The string will be
shown on the second occurrence, and the minilesson will be shown on subsequent
occurrences.
