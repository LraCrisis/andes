Units in Andes2 Design</h2></center>

<h3>
Joel</h3></center>
This is a list of questions relevant to the treatment of physical units
in the Andes2 system.
<p>It is generally agreed that proper treatment of units in Andes lies
somewhere between desirable and essential. The algebra system has been
designed to be able to carry unit checking, and work is in progress on
transferring the necessary information. Some of the issues are
<ul>
<li>
Do we need to incorporate units nontrivially in Andes?</li>

<br>Physical quantities generally have <b>dimensions</b> --- a speed can
be 8 m/s or 8 miles/hr but it is meaningless to say the speed is 8. Such
language lost a Martial probe costing hundreds of millions of dollars.
Andes1 had the dimensions of quantities in the knowledge base but made
no use of them other than knowing what to ignore in a student's answer.
I believe we are now agreed that Andes2 should require correct units. Here
is some of the discussion that led to that (just what I could dig up -
there are undoubtedly many missing pieces)
<ul>
<li>
<a href="needunits1.html">Early discussion (August 2000)</a></li>

<li>
<a href="needunits2.html">December 2000)</a></li>
</ul>

<li>
How should units be represented in the knowledge base?</li>

<ul>
<li>
Should units in the KB look like m/s^2 or (/ (^ s 2) m)?</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="unitsA1.html">Anders asks</a></li>

<li>
<a href="unitsK1.html">Kurt's response</a></li>

<li>
<a href="unitsJ3.html">Joel's response</a></li>
</ul>
I believe the upshot of this discussion is that units should be expressed
in book (or canonical) form&nbsp;<t>kg.m/s^2</t> in a defprob and in any
subsequent expressions that a physicist might need to examine, but that
it be converted to a lisp form (* kg (/ m (^ s 2))) before being presented
to the algebra system. <b>[Actually the last comment has been reconsidered,
and we are now planning to store all units in "book form", eg. kg.m/s^2]</b>
[Note: this probably means that the probname.Eqn file has lisp form, even
though a physicist might examine it.]</ul>

<li>
How units are represented internally in the algebra system</li>

<br>The algebra system is designed to express all quantities in SI units
with given powers of meters [m], kilograms [kg], seconds [s], Coulombs
[C], and degrees Kelvin [K]. However, there are unresolved issues which
will need subtle consideration:
<ul>
<li>
How are angles expressed? Currently all angles (without units) are interpreted
as in degrees, even though this is highly non-standard. Angular velocities
and accelerations, however, are expressed in rad/sec, which will certainly
give problems once we consider waves and want to evaluate cos(omega t).
Furthermore, the rules for dropping rad are irreversible - while it is
easy to recognize that in v = omega r if omega = 10 rad/s and r = 2 m,
v is 20 m/s and not 20 m rad/s, it is less easy to rcognize that, given
v and r, omega is not 10/s.</li>

<li>
What non-standard units are accepted, and do we simply convert on input
and give all answers in MKS, or convert at output as well, or not convert.
See Exkt1a, Exkt9a.</li>

<li>
Even the standard units have many abbreviations - they are not always expressed
in terms of the fundamental units. Here is a list of SI units (not necessarily
complete)</li>

<br>m, kg, s, N, J, K, C, V, A, T, ohm, Wb, Hz, Pa, F, H, W
<li>
and there are standard prefix modifiers, of which we should recognize</li>

<br>a, f, p, n, mu, m, c, k or K, M, G, T, P, E , from which I have dropped
the little used d, h, da
<li>
There are a set of nearly essential alternates to SI:</li>

<br>eV, MeV, c, u, Angstrom, atm, f (fermi), barn, cal, ^oC, lightyear,
liter,
<br>and also English and other archaic units:
<br>Btu, ^oF, ft, in, hr, min, hp, lb, day, yr, yd, mi, gal, oz, slug,
bar, Kwh
<br>and of course physicists sometimes slip into cgs units:
<br>CGS: G (gauss), g gram, dyne, erg</ul>

<li>
What are acceptible units?</li>

<ul>
<li>
What are the rules to impose on students in expressing units? This has
had some discussion:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="unitsJ2.html">Joel to all Andes folk, 12/7</a></li>
</ul>

<li>
What is the grammar for expressing units when the help or workbench are
conveying them to the algebra system?</li>

<br>These systems are presenting units in the same form as the students,
but the algebra system should be able to rely on their being presented
more cleanly, with a tighter grammar. We need some notes giving the specs.</ul>
</ul>
