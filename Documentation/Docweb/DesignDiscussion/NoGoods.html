Collin (5/2/01):</h3>
After connecting the Algebra system and the workbench to the help system
we have rediscovered the need for Nogoods.&nbsp; It is now apparent that
a small number of nogoods will be necessary to address situations specific
to the Workbench and to address Combinatorial explosion.&nbsp; Accordingly
we have reinroduced nogoods into the solution graph generatior and into
the runtime help system.&nbsp; Given the existence of the Algebra system
the Nogoods now serve a much smaller purpose.&nbsp; The goal of the nogoods
is to account for possible entries and solutions that are algebraically
possible but are prevented by the workbench.&nbsp; At solution graph generation
time the nogoods are used to further prune the possible solution paths.&nbsp;
At Andes2 Runtime they are used to prune off the algebraic solution sets
that are used to identify equations.&nbsp; The student should never see
them nor even knw that they exist as they are rendered invisible by the
workbench.
<p>At present we hasve introduced two nogoods:
<h5>
Conflicting Axes:</h5>

<blockquote>In solving any physics problem it is algebraically leal for
the student to use as many axes as they might wish.&nbsp; Therefore they
can select several axes for a single body and write each equation on that
body using one or more of those axes.&nbsp; The Andes2 Knowledge base implicity
prevents the use of more that two axes for any given body.&nbsp; However
within this limitation it is still algebraically plausible for the student
to write equations on a given body using both axes.&nbsp; This results
in a combinatorial explosion of undesireable (pedagogically and computationally)
solution paths.</blockquote>

<h5>
Non-Orthagonal Axes:</h5>

<blockquote>Again, it is algebraically valid to select x and y axes that
are non-orthagonal.&nbsp; In some problems this might even reduce the number
of steps necessary to produce a solution.&nbsp; However it is not possible
to enter non-orthagonal axes in the Andes Workbench, nor have the physicists
evidiced a desire to permit the students to do so.&nbsp; Therefore we have
edded a nogood to block these solutions from being produced in the SGG.</blockquote>

Kurt (3/16/01):</h3>
After thinking it through with Anders and Joel, it now appears that no-goods
will not be necessary.&nbsp; This message says why, mostly so I won't forget
when it comes time to write papers on Andes2.
<p>I used to think that associating text with a no-good, such as "It is
a never necessary to use a third kinematics equation," would allow us to
give better help messages in two circumstances.
<p>First, if the student has entered several equations and then enters
one that is "no-good," I thought that Andes should give the no-good message
then color the equation red.&nbsp; However, Joel and Anders pointed out
that the current design (as of 3/14/01), doesn't give such messages.&nbsp;
We thought and thought, but couldn't devise a scenario where such a help
message would be appropriate.&nbsp; For instance, suppose a student had
written two primitive kinematics equations down and now writes a third.&nbsp;
Andes shouldn't mark it red and give the help message above, because the
student might simply be doing an algebraic combination of the two earlier
kinematics equations, or might be switching to a better solution, or might
be rederiving the third equation instead of trying to recall it.&nbsp;
All of these are good practices that we don't want to discourage.&nbsp;
Thus, we should simply mark that third kinematics equation green.&nbsp;
Similar attempts with axis rotation, forces-vs-energies and other no-goods
yielded similar results.&nbsp; So there is no reason to have text associated
with no-good for the sake of help messages.
<p>The second place where no-good messages would be necessary, I thought,
was when&nbsp; What's-next help is generating a preamble, and it has just
gotten a sought quantity from the student, so it asks "What method should
you use to find it?" and gives a hierarchical menu.&nbsp; If the student's
menu selection is a PSM that, according to the no-good, is dependent on
the equations inside the students bubble (i.e., the equations that the
student and tutor have mentioned so far in the preamble), then the no-good's
message would be printed and the student would be asked to make another
menu selection.&nbsp; Joel has convinced me that it would be pedagogically
better to give the student a general message instead, such as "That method
will generate an equation that provides no new information, because it
can be algebraically derived from your equations &lt;number> and &lt;number>"&nbsp;
This general message can be computed by calling Joel's independence checker
after the student has made the menu selection.&nbsp; If it reports that
the student's proposed equation is dependent on ones in the student's bubble,
then it can also report which equations in the bubble the student's proposed
equtaion is dependent on, and those are the ones mentioned in the message.
<p>Thus, we no longer need no-goods, and that code can be flushed from
both the knowledge base (Anders) and the solution graph generator (Collin).&nbsp;
Instead, the SGG will call Joel's independence checker while tracing all
possible paths through the bubble graph.&nbsp; Also, the What's-next help
will call Joel's independence checker as described above.
