We might bring these up for discussion with the usna folk.
<P>
Should we change the treatment of axial vectors, like angular
velocity, angular momentum, torque, magnetic field?
<P>
  In a two dimensional world these are really scalar (actually
pseudoscalar) quantities, which we are representing by the z component
of a vector. But describing such a quantity in a two dimensional
world in term of a vector magnitude and a polar angle seems very
artificial. I think the workbench would be clearer if it said
counterclockwise/clockwise or out of/into the plane, rather than
phi = 0 or 180. Also, it is very awkward to write out equations in terms
of the magnitude and phi, as witness my complaints on the torque problems
some time ago.
