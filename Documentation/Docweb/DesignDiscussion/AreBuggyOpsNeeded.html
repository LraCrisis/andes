Do we need buggy operators in the KB?</h2></center>

<h3>
Kurt:</h3>
It is traditional to analyze errors by using buggy operators.&nbsp; A buggy
operator is just a regular operator except that its conclusions are false.&nbsp;
If one uses buggy operators, then all propostoins have to be marked to
distinguish correct ones from those produced by bugs.
<p>The problem with buggy operators is that they can combine combinatorially
with correct operators and produce a horendous number of solutions.
<p>Fortunately, all errors I have seen so far can be interpreted by modifing
the students entry to make it correct (see discussion).&nbsp; Thus, it
appears that we do not (yet) need buggy operators.&nbsp; Let's design under
the assumption that buggy ops will not be needed.
