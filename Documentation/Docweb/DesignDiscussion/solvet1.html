We might bring these up for discussion with the usna folk.

What should the solve tool do?  Currently it apparently looks for a
path analogous to that taken by the bubble graph, but where equations that
involve variables in the bubble, other than the current sought, are not
allowed. So it doesn't solve simultaneous linear equations, and I am not
sure what it does on nonlinear ones. It is also not clear what it considers
an answer.
<P>
   It seems to me that it might be better to provide a tool which does
less for the student. What I have in mind is a tool that permits the
student to select a variable AND AN EQUATION to solve for, and after seeing
the equation rewritten in the form var = expression, a tool which permits
him to make this substitution in other equations of his choosing. The
system would perform simple algebraic simplifications.
<P>
   There are two advantages. First of all, it is something the system
should be able to do reliably, while finding the best partial solution
of a large set of equations with many undetermined variables may not be.
Secondly, it insists that the student do the algebraic planning himself,
while performing the grungy tasks of substitution and simplification for
him.
