<h2>
Should interpretations be filtered by axes?</h2></center>

<h3>
Collin (5/2/01):</h3>
Reasessment of the Nogoods issue <a href="NoGoods.html">here</a> has caused
us to reasess the need for axis filtering.&nbsp; It is now apparent that
the system that we have outlined below is no longer valid.&nbsp; Therefore
when student entries are made the system will keep track of their assumptions
and use them to filter out those solution sets that use conflicting axis
rotations.&nbsp; This will prevent the students from being as flexible
as they may like.&nbsp; However it serves a useful pedagogical function
by forcing the students to select an axis and then 'stick with it'.&nbsp;
Joel has asserted that this is what physics professors desire to see in
their students.&nbsp; It also has the benefit of reducing the workload
of the runtime help system.

For instance, suppose that you had the classic block sliding down a frictionless
30 degree inclined plane.&nbsp; Consider two ways to derive N=-W*sin(240).
<ul>
<li>
If one draws axes tilted 30 degrees, then this equation can be easily derived
by Newton's first law, N_y+W_y=0 and N_y=N and W_y=W*sin(270-30), so N=W*sin(240).&nbsp;
The cognitive load of this derivation is 6, assuming 2 points per primitive
equation.</li>

<li>
On the other hand, if you draw unrotated axes, then you can derive the
same equation in a more complex fashion: N_y+W_y=m*a_y and N_y=N*sin(120),
W_y=-W and a_y= a*sin(210).&nbsp; Thus, N= (m*a*sin(210) +W)/sin(120).&nbsp;&nbsp;
By applying NSL along the x-axis, solving it for a, and substituting into
this equation, we get N = (m*[(N*cos(120))/(m*cos(210))]*sin(210) +W)/sin(120).&nbsp;
This simplifies to N=W*sin(240).&nbsp; The cognitive load of this derivation
is 14, assuming 2 points per primitive equation.&nbsp; This is of course
a gross underestimate, because the simplification step is quite difficult
but contributes nothing to the cognitive load calculation.</li>
</ul>
Now, suppose that a novice student (i.e., one who still is required to
enter pre-requisites) drew unrotated axes, wrote N_y+W_y=m*a_y and N_x+W_x=m*a_x,
and then wrote N=-W*sin(240).&nbsp; What interpretation should Andes assign
it?
<ul>
<li>
If we believe the student is using the axis rotation that she drew, then
she has done a great deal of work in her head, but the equation is correct
and not premature (because she entered both compo equations, and the 5
projection equations don't have to be written).&nbsp; Thus, Andes will
just turn N=-W*sin(240) green.</li>

<li>
On the other hand, if the student has mentally envisioned a rotated coordinate
system, then N=-W*sin(240) can be derived simply but it is premature.&nbsp;
If Andes accepts this interpretation, then it will tell the student that
the equation is premature and the student must draw the appropriate coordinate
axes first.&nbsp; Then the workbench then leaves N=-W*sin(240) black.&nbsp;
When the student tries to enter the rotated coordinate system, Andes will
refuse to do it until the existing coordinate system is deleted.&nbsp;
Deleting the existing coordinate system causes N_y+W_y=m*a_y and N_x+W_x=m*a_x
to go red, since they are defined in terms of the undefined variables.&nbsp;
Defining a new rotated coordinate system causes the two equations to go
black, since they now have their variables defined.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Instead
of deleting and redrawing the axes, the student could also modify the existing
axes using the right mouse button, which would cause the two equations
to become black when the dialog box is closed.)</li>
</ul>
In short, Andes gives very different responses depending on which interpretation
is accepted.&nbsp; If the entry interpreter always prefers intertations
with minimal cognitive load, then it will prefer the rotated axes interpretation
because its load is 6 whereas the load of the unrotated axes interpretation
is 10.
<p>Thus, the design alternatives are:
<ul>
<li>
always accept the interpretation with the lowest cognitive load.</li>

<li>
when axes are entered, filter out interpretations that are not consistent
with those axes.</li>

<li>
usually prefer interpretations with lowest cognitive load, except when
they use axes that conflict with axes that the student has written.&nbsp;
In this case, Andes asks the student, "That equation is simpler to derive
if you use a coordinate system that is rotated by &lt;degrees> degrees.&nbsp;
But your coordinate system has a different rotation.&nbsp; Which one did
you use to derive this equation?" and gives the student a menu with two
choices: (a) The coordinate system I drew, which is rotated ~a degrees.
(b) The coordinate system that I have not drawn, which is rotated ~a degrees.&nbsp;
If the student picks (a), then the dialog ends, the equation turns green
and the Entry Interpreter chooses the higher-load interpretation.&nbsp;
If the student picks (b), then she is told, "You should modify the coordinate
system (click on it with the right mouse button) so that it is rotated
~a degrees.&nbsp; On an exam, if you don't show the coordinate system that
you are actually using, then you may not get full credit for your work,
because graders won't be able to tell how you derived your equations."
When the student closes this dialog, the equation (e.g., N=-W*sin(240))
stays black, and the Entry interpreter does not count it as entered.&nbsp;
If the student tries to re-enter the equation, then exactly the same thing
happens.&nbsp; The only way the student can get the equation to become
green is to either pick option (a) or to redraw the axes as recommended.</li>
</ul>
Joel and I like the third alternative, even though it is the most complex
to implement and it only handles a rather rare case.&nbsp; However, given
that the same entry propositions can have different prerequisite, it becomes
very difficult to determine what system entry is the violated prerequisite
(see <a href="EntryPropositionAmbiguity.html#eq entry propositions have eq pre-reqs">discussion</a>).&nbsp;
Thus, the solution graph module currently only determines if a prerequisite
violation exists and not what the prerequisite is (see <a href="../SolutionGraph.html#Checking prerequisites">solution
graph module</a>).&nbsp; As a consequence, we can't implement the behavior
that Joel and I like.&nbsp; What will happen in this odd cases is that
the system will find that there is at least one way to derive the equation
without violating any prerequisite (namely, using the unrotated axes),
so it will turn the student's entry green.
