<h2>
Should we recognize entries along dead paths?</h2></center>

Kurt:</h3>
A dead-path is a failed search path generated by backwards chaining from
the sought quantity.&nbsp; As an illustration, suppose a problem seeks
acceleration and it can be solved via Newton's second law.&nbsp; However,
the solver will also try to solve it via kinematics, because those PSMs
also contain acceleration.&nbsp; So PSMs for kinematics are constructed
and added to the solution graph.&nbsp; However, when the solver tries to
determine values for some of the quantities in the kinematics PSMs, it
will fail.&nbsp; Thus, the kinematics PSMs become dead-paths.
<p>The question is whether to keep these dead-path PSMs around in the solution
graph so that Andes can recognize entries along dead paths and give the
appropriate feedback.&nbsp; If they are not kept in the solution graph,
then dead-path entries are given the same feedback ordinary incorrect entries.
<p>One caveat is that we cannot recognize dead-path equations even if we
wanted to.&nbsp; To do color-by-numbers on a dead-path equation would require
having values for its variables, but those values are not determined by
the problem statement.&nbsp; We could make some numbers up, and that would
suffice perhaps, but I worry about getting values that are consistent with
each other and the rest of the quantities in the problem that are determined
by the problem statement.&nbsp; So let's not bother.
<p>Thus, if a student tries to enter a dead-path equation, Andes won't
be able to recognize it, so the equation will be turned red.&nbsp; This
suggests that we should prevent them from even trying to enter such equations
by marking dead-path quantities red.&nbsp; A dead-path quantity is one
that appears only on a dead-path.&nbsp; Every dead-path equation includes
at least one dead-path quantity.&nbsp; Thus, if we mark dead-path quantities
red, students will get an undefined variable message when they try to enter
a dead-path equation.&nbsp; If they click on the red dead-path quantity,
then we can give what's wrong help that explains what a dead-path is and
why Andes can't handle recognition of anything other than successful paths.
<p>This seems like a good idea because it explains in a concrete way exactly
what Andes red/green feedback means.
<p>More importantly, if dead-paths are not kept around, then dead-path
entries will be treated like regular incorrect entries by What's Wrong
help.&nbsp; For instance, suppose that&nbsp; kinematics is a dead-path
and that the student prepares to enter a kinematics equation by drawing
an final velocity vector.&nbsp; Even if the final velocity really is exactly
as the student drew it, Andes will mark it red.&nbsp; This will occur regardless
of whether Andes knows the entry is on a dead-path or not.&nbsp; If the
student asks for What's Wrong help, then if Andes knows that final velocity
is on a dead-path, it will say so.&nbsp; If it doesn't, then the error
handlers will probably think the student is trying to enter the initial
velocity and advise the student to draw that instead.&nbsp; Suppose the
student follows the advice despite being mystified by it, then tries again
to draw the final velocity.&nbsp; Again it turns red, and this time What's
Wrong can't find a closely matching unentered correct entry, so it gives
What's Next help.&nbsp; That's not so bad, but the student will still be
mystified about what Andes didn't recognize an obviously correct vector.
<p>In short, I think we should include dead paths in the solution graph
so that we can recognize non-equation dead-path entries and give appropriate
feedback.
