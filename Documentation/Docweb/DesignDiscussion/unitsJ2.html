units for quantities

We have, I believe, agreed that the new version of Andes should
treat units seriously, so I am beginning to try to incorporate them
in the parsing. I have looked at the log files which Anders has
cleaned up for me, and examined the first 112 equations which involved
or should have involved units, and classified them as follows
								num/112
A: assignment statements with correct units, eg G=9.8 m/s^2	59
B: assignment statements with correct units even though 0	 3
C: units included where they should not have been, eg		 1
	ag=(vp_y-vj_y)/(t1-t0)m/s^2
D: assignment statements with units missing, eg Fw_y = -98	34
E: units omitted when number plugged into equation		10
	eg.   -29.4 + Ft_y = 3 * ag_y
F: units left off when quantity is 0				 5

I propose we accept A, B and F, and clearly we want to not accept
C and D (C comes from a misconception that the variables are numbers
associated with the physical quantities rather than the quantities
themselves, including units). The one situation which is not completely
clear is E - it is wrong, but we all do it in the course of doing our
algebra, hopefully restoring the units at the end. But I think we might
do well to be strict here, because
	1) it will be hard for novices to remember when they are
		using shorthand by dropping the units and when they
		really aren't there
	2) the extra pain of writing units when plugging values into
		an equation will encourage them not to do that, which
		we want to do anyway.
	3) it will be hard to check units in equations if they are left
		off.
	4) we should be reluctant to mark correct things which are not
		really correct.

So, I propose we accept A, B, F and mark C,D, and E wrong. (Accepting
F makes my life harder, but no physicist would object to v=0 as a legitimate
statement).

Grammar:
	A quantity involving units should begin with a number,
followed without an initial * by a composite of the symbols
	m, kg, s, N, J, K, C, mol, V, A, T, ohm, Wb, Hz, Pa, F, H, W
	eV, MeV, c, u
	and prefixes a f p n mu m c  k M G T P E
	( I left out d, h da, which are almost never used except for dl,
	which we would write as 10^{-4} m^3. c is used only with cm, as
	we shouldn't accept cc's anyway (cc = 10^{-6}m^3)
   what about general non-SI:
  	  Angstrom, atm, f (=fm), barn, cal, ^oC, lightyear, liter
	English and other archiac units
	  Btu,  ^oF, ft, in, hr, min, hp, lb, day, yr, yd, mi, gal, oz,
	  slug,
	CGS: G (gauss), g gram, dyne, erg, bar, Kwh
These symbols can be combined with or without *, with / and ^, but we
	need to know the rules: J/K mol = J/(K * mol), right?

I am not sure what the parsing rules should be. In assignment statements,
like I = 8 mA, it is easy, because once you hit a number followed by a
symbol without an intervening operator you can permanantly switch to
unit gathering. But if we allow quantities in equations, how do I know
	P = 8 V * mA is 8 mW rather than 8 volts times the mass of A?

Comments?
