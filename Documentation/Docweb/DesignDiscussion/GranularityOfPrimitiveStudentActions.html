Granularity of Primitive Student Actions.</h2></center>

<h3>
Kurt:</h3>
Andes1 defined a primitive student action to consiste of entering a whole
dialog box worth of information or filling in an equation.&nbsp; Let us
call this the "dialog box" grain size.
<p>However, we could define a primitive student action to be actuating
one of the controls in the dialog box.&nbsp; Andes dialog boxes use 4 types
of controls: drop down menus, fill-in-the-blank, radio buttons, and push
buttons.&nbsp; As soon as the user enters a new setting for one of the
controls, the Workbench could notify the Help system.&nbsp; Let us call
this the "control" grain size.
<p><i>Differences from the student's point of view</i>
<p>Andes gives flag feedback on primitive student actions.&nbsp; If the
control grain size is used, then every time the student actuates a control,
it turns red or green.&nbsp; If the dialog box grain size is used, then
the student fills out the whole dialog box and closes it before getting
any feedback.&nbsp; (In Andes1, flag feedback on a dialog box was given
by turning one of its controls red, which makes it look like it is using
a control grain size even though it is not.)
<p>Students can only ask for help in between primitive actions.&nbsp; In
particular, if the dialog box grain size is used, then the students must
fill out the whole thing before they can ask for what's next help.
<p>Andes can give long help dialogs in between primitive actions.&nbsp;
With control grain size, there could be a partially filled out dialog box
is still on the screen during the dialog.&nbsp; It must be movable because
the student might want to see underneath it while talking to the tutor.
<p><i>Some pedagogical considerations:</i>
<p>If students get stuck while filling out part of a dialog box, then it
would be nice for them to be able to ask for what's-next help right then.&nbsp;
This could be easily done with the control grain size, but with the dialog
box grain size, students would probably cancel the dialog box in order
to ask for help.&nbsp; This would make it impossible for Andes to tell
what part of the dialog box the student wanted help on.&nbsp; In fact,
wouldn't even know what kind of dialog box the student wanted help on filling
out.&nbsp; Andes would have to walk the whole bubble graph and PSM in order
to find out what to give help on.&nbsp; This will discourage the students
from asking for help.
<p>Moreover, the hint in this case would have to cover everything the student
needs to know in order to fill in the dialog box.&nbsp; For instance, students
often make errors in filling out the time specifiers, but Andes hints rarely
mention them.&nbsp; Every control in the dialog box requires some knowledge
to fill it out, but a hint that mentioned all that knowledge would be so
long that few students would read it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the control grain
size, Andes would know which controls have already been filled in correctly,
so it could limit its hints to those that are not yet filled in.&nbsp;
This would make them shorter and more likely to be attended to.
<p>However, giving control grain size help has some problems of its own.&nbsp;
First, if more than one control were unfilled when the student asked for
whats-next help, Andes would not know which control they are stuck on,
so it might have to ask or guess.&nbsp; Second, the student might ask for
help before any controls are filled out because they get stuck on the first
one that they try.&nbsp; Andes would have little idea of their intention
is for the whole dialog box, so it might have to ask or guess.&nbsp; In
short, although control grain size has the capability of giving more pointed
hints than dialog grain, it still requires good guesses or questions to
deliver exactly the right hint.
<p>If control grain size is used and a control has only a small number
of choices (e.g., the radio button for net force vs. individual force,
or the choice between average and instantaneous velocity), then student
who get red feedback on their first choice are very likely to just change
it without thinking.&nbsp; That's really bad for their learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In fact, our plan is to turn off that aspect of flag feedback from Andes1.&nbsp;
If we did use control grain size, then we'd have to make the flag feedback
smarter so that it would only occur some of the time.&nbsp; That is, controls
would sometimes stay black instead of turning colors.&nbsp; When enough
controls are actuated, then the flag feedback coloring occurs.
<p>If control grain size is used, and then the sequence in which controls
are actuated can have an overly strong influence on how the student's actions
are interpreted.&nbsp; For instance, when the force dialog box is opened,
the rotation control is filled in already.&nbsp; This pretty much determines
what force ought to go into the box.&nbsp; Suppose for instance, that the
student draws a force straight down on a problem where there is a weight
force and a normal force, and the normal force is at 30 degrees.&nbsp;
Since there exists just one force that is straight down (weight), the theta
control is green and Andes will think that the student is going to fill
in the rest of the box to make a weight force.&nbsp; But suppose the student
STRING as the agent of the force and gets red.&nbsp; The student ignores
that and enters TENSION as the type of the force.&nbsp; Suppose that that
also turns red.&nbsp; Now the student asks what's wrong.&nbsp; Andes will
give what's wrong advice on the type, and suggest that it should be weight.&nbsp;
This could be confusing to the student, who is clearly trying to enter
a normal force and has the angle wrong.&nbsp; This is another reason for
making flag feedback smarter, and sometime leaving control black until
other controls are entered.
<p>If control grain size is used, then Andes may have to give help when
it is not yet clear what the student's intentions are.&nbsp; For instance,
if the student draws a force at a 90 degree angle, and there is no 90 degree
force on any body at any time, then the angle control will turn red. If
the student asks what's wrong, then Andes will have no clue what force
the student is trying to enter.&nbsp; The best it can do is to say, "There
is no relevant force in this problem with that angle.&nbsp; I'm not sure
what force you were trying to enter.&nbsp; Please fill in some more of
the dialog box then ask for help again."&nbsp; This is not such a bad thing.<i></i>
<p><i>Differences to the knowledge representation</i>
<p>With the control grain size, there would be many more operators needed
in the KB but there would also be a direct correspondence between operators
and the GUI.&nbsp; For each type of dialog box, there would be one operator.&nbsp;
For each of the controls in the dialog box, there would be one precondition
in the dialog box operator.&nbsp; Each precondition correspond directly
to the goal of actuating that control.&nbsp; For each such goal, there
is at least one operator that fills out that control.&nbsp; Hints for filling
out a control are located directly on those operators.&nbsp; Hints for
deciding whether to open a dialog box are located on the dialog-box operator.
<p>With the dialog box grain size, there should be one goal for each type
of dialog box, and for each type of goal, there would be at least one operator
that achieves it.&nbsp; These operators represent filling out the whole
dialog box.&nbsp; The hints sequence on such operators explain how to fill
out all the controls in the dialog box.
<p>For an example, consider the force dialog box, which has controls for
net vs. individual force, body, agent, type, time and direction.&nbsp;
In the dialog box grain size, there is one operator for each variety of
force.&nbsp; For instance, there would be one operator for weight, and
it would "fill in" all the controls.&nbsp; It's hint sequence should explain
all the properties of weight forces (a) its an individual force (b) the
body is the object that we are applying the PSM to, (c) the agent is the
earth, (d) the type is Weight, not gravity, (e) the time is the time of
whole PSM and (f) the direction is straight down.&nbsp; Now our current
hints do not cover all these points.&nbsp; None of them, for instance,
mention points (b) and (e), yet students sometimes make exactly those errors,
so we really do need longer hints that cover all 6 points.&nbsp; However,
if Andes printed such a long hint, students might not read it because it
was so long.&nbsp; Ideally, Andes should only print the part of the hint
that corresponds to the controls that are not set correctly.&nbsp; This
suggests using the control grain size.
<p>In the control grain size representation, we'd need on operator to represent
the whole force dialog box, and it would have 6 preconditions (one for
each control).&nbsp; There would be at least one operator per control.&nbsp;
Because students can fill in the controls in any order, we want hints for
controls to make sense regardless of what order the controls are actuated.&nbsp;
This means that there must be several operators per control.&nbsp; For
the Type control, one operator fires if the agent control is not actuated.&nbsp;
It chooses a type corresponding to a force that it knows exists in this
problem.&nbsp; A second operator fires if the Agent control has been actuated.&nbsp;
It chooses a type that is appropraite only for that agent in the context
of this problem.&nbsp; The two operators have different hint sequences,
of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows Andes to give hints that depend on the
particular context--namely, what controls have been set so far.
<p>In the control grain size KR, there will be many choices in the PSM
graphs, because there will be many different orders in which the controls
can be filled out.&nbsp; We would have to invent some new kind of fancy
data structure to encode this, or a small combinatorial explosition.
<p>Either knowledge representation, it is sometimes economical to have
separate operators to figure out the values of some controls than others.&nbsp;
For instance, one operator might figure out that a normal force exists
and fill out the controls for time, body, agent and type.&nbsp; Another
operator would figure out the angle of the normal force, and fill out the
theta control.&nbsp; This is economical because there is generally only
one operator for defining the existance of an object, but there can be
several operators for determining certain "properties" such as directions.&nbsp;
This happens naturally in the control grain size KR.&nbsp; However, it
can't be used in the dialog box KR.&nbsp; The dialog box KR needs to have
all the right hints right there on the operator that filled out the dialog
box.&nbsp; This means that there has to be different operators for each
combination of properties.
<p>Currently, error handlers are not associated with the operators because
they are at the control grain size and the operators are at the dialog
grain size.&nbsp; Error handlers for non-equation entries typically locates
a closest matching correct operator that differs from the student's entry
by one or two controls.&nbsp; The hint sequence attached to such an error
handler talks about only those controls.&nbsp; So the error handlers are
really at the control grain size.&nbsp; If the whole KR had a control grain
size, then perhaps the error handlers could be more integrated with the
operators.
<p><i>Conclusions</i>
<p>The main advantage of the control grain size is that it allows hints
to be more narrowly focused, which would tend to make them more pertinent
and hence more appreciated.&nbsp; It also adds a certain elegance to the
KR and perhaps the rest of the system.&nbsp; However, many parts of the
Help system would have to become more complex in order to take advantage
of this new power and to avoid abusing it (e.g., given flag feedback that
encourages guessing).&nbsp; On the whole, we can't afford to lower the
grain size right now.
