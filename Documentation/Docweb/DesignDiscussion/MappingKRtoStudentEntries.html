What in the KR corresponds to the student's entries?</h2></center>

<h3>
Kurt:</h3>
The KR currently has two kinds of instantiated objects: propositions and
operator applications.&nbsp; Some of these represent non-equation student
entries, but there is currently no uniform convention for the mapping.&nbsp;
There are essentially three options:
<p><i>Propositions</i>:
<br>We let certain propositions represent student entries.&nbsp; That is,
we design a simple mapping between these types of propositions and the
dialog boxes that are used to enter non-equations.&nbsp; For instance,
there are 7 controls in the Force dialog box:
<ul>
<li>
net force vs. individual force</li>

<li>
body</li>

<li>
agent</li>

<li>
type</li>

<li>
time</li>

<li>
variable name</li>

<li>
theta</li>
</ul>
In addition, the vector can be drawn as zero-length or non-zero length.&nbsp;
The <a href="../LookupForce.html">student entry info passed in from the
workbench h</a>as all these slots, except the first one because the net
force is treated as a type of force.&nbsp; No proposition in the KR currently
contains all this information, so we would have to invent one.&nbsp; We
can leave out the variable name, because forces don't have names in the
KR.&nbsp; Also, it is slightly cleaner to define one proposition for net
force and one proposition for normal force:
<ul>
<li>
(Net-force &lt;body> &lt;time> &lt;theta> &lt;zero/nonzero>)</li>

<li>
(Force &lt;body> &lt;agent> &lt;type> &lt;time> &lt;theta> &lt;zero/nonzero>)</li>
</ul>
In a similar fashion, we define propositions for every dialog box in the
GUI.&nbsp; In most cases, there is is just one proposition type per dialog
box type.&nbsp; The point is to keep the mapping as simple and natural
as possible.&nbsp; Let us call these propositions Entry Propositions.&nbsp;
There is also a general purpose equation Entry Proposition of the form
(EQN &lt;equation>).
<p>Entry propositions function just like regular propositions in the KB.&nbsp;
They can appear in preconditions or conclusions.&nbsp; Many operators might
produce Entry Propositions of the same type: e.g., Draw-Weight and Draw-Normal
might both produce Force propositions, but the value of the Type arguments
will be different.&nbsp; The hint sequences of these operators teach everything
the student needs to know in order to draw that force.
<p>Inside the Help system, Entry Propositions appear in 3 places:&nbsp;
the student entry structure, the system entry structure and the PSM path
nodes.&nbsp; When the entry interpreter is trying to figure out what a
student entry is, it tests for equality between the Entry Proposition in
the student entry struct and the Entry Proposition in various system entry
structs.
<p>This requires the KB author (Anders) to gather together information
into one proposition is currently spread among multiple propositions.&nbsp;
However, having to do that could arguably be code higene, as it forces
the KB to allign more closely with the GUI.&nbsp; Moreover, there is something
satisfyingly semantical about having a single proposition represent a single
object on the screen.
<p><i>Operators</i>:
<br>We let certain operators represent the action of drawing the non-equation
entry.&nbsp; For the force dialog box, there is just one operator that
actually draws a force, but it is fed information by many operators such
as Notice-Weight and Notice-Normal.&nbsp; These feeder operators contain
the hint sequences that the what's-next help will present.&nbsp; The Force
drawing operator itself has no hint sequence.&nbsp; However, it has arguments
that provide all the information needed for matching a student entry.&nbsp;
In particular, the force operator's arguments would be:
<ul>
<li>
(Force &lt;body> &lt;agent> &lt;type> &lt;time> &lt;theta> &lt;zero/nonzero>)</li>
</ul>
When the values of the arguments are filled in, we have an operator instance.&nbsp;
We could call these things Entry Op Instances.
<p>Entry Op Instances appear in 3 places: the student enty structure, the
system entry structure and the PSM path nodes.&nbsp; When the entry interpreter
is trying to figure out what a student entry is, it tests for equality
between the Entry Op Instance in the student entry struct and the Entry
Op Instance in various system entry structs.
<p>This requires the KB author to modify lots of operators.&nbsp; It is
arguably the most semantically clean formulation because filling out a
dialog box is an action and so is an operator application.&nbsp; Indeed,
if carried a couple of steps further, we end up making operators that correspond
to actuating each control in the dialog box.&nbsp; That is a really, really
semantically clean formulation that is discussed and discarded <a href="GranularityOfPrimitiveStudentActions.html">here</a>.
<p><i>Hetrogeneous</i>:
<br>This is what we do now, so no modifications of the KB are required.&nbsp;
The information required to match a student entry can appear in multiple
places: the arguments of an operator instance and the propositions produced
when it fires, and maybe some other propositions produced by earlier operator
applications.&nbsp; This means that we have to invent some data structure
(let's call it an Entry Instance) that compactly represents all the required
info.&nbsp; For the force dialog box, the Entry Instance would be:
<ul>
<li>
(Force &lt;body> &lt;agent> &lt;type> &lt;time> &lt;theta> &lt;zero/nonzero>)</li>
</ul>
Like the Entry Propositions and Entry Op Instances, it appears in the student
enty structure and the system entry structure, and when the entry interpreter
is trying to figure out what a student entry is, it tests for equality
between the Entry Instance in the student entry struct and the Entry Instance
in various system entry structs.
<p>However, Entry Instances do not appear in the PSM path nodes.&nbsp;
Instead, we have an ad hoc Lisp function that inputs a PSM path that leads
up to a particular node, and it outputs an Entry Instance or NIL.&nbsp;
We need the path leading up to the node as well as the node itself because
sometimes the required information was produced by earlier operator applications,
so this function has to go looking for it.&nbsp; Ugh.
<p>The hints for an Entry Instance reside on the operator that produced
the PSM path node that the Entry Instance was derived from.
<p><i>Conclusion</i>:
<br>The proposition solution is closer to the way the KB works now, and
more elegant than the other two.
