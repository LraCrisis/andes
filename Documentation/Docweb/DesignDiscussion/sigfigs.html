Accuracy in numerical values of quantities

Physical quantities generally are not given or known exactly -- there
are errors in every measurement, and we are generally satisfied with
finding approximate values for physical values, not exact numbers.
<p>
The propagation of errors in forming an algebraic expression is well
understood but can lead to surprizing results under some circumstances.
For example, if the determinant involved in a set of linear equations
is small, the answers found for the variables may have much larger
relative or absolute errors than the input numbers. Errors in a small
determinant can also confuse the situation with that where the determinant
is zero, which changes qualitatively the nature of the solution.
<P>
For this reason, it is important for the algebra system to use high 
accuracy in its internal evaluations, and to have givens in a problem
consistent to high accuracy. However, we do not want to ask students
to specify numerical quantities to 15 places, nor to calculate to that
accuracy. Therefore there needs to be another standard for numerical 
values in student answers and in student equations.
<P>
It is somewhat traditional to ask that values be specified to three
significant figures, probably because that is the best you could ask
for from your slide rule. That would probably be a reasonable criterion
for final answers in general, though I suspect there will be exceptions
where this seems artificial. There are, however, <em>definitely</em> 
situations for which this is inadequate for intermediate numerical 
specifications. For example, in Serway, Principles of Physics, Example
30.5, in calculating the disintegration energy of Radium,
the masses of <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>222</sup>Rn are given to
nine significant figures. Had the values been rounded to three 
significant figures one would conclude that Radon was stable rather
than finding that 4.87 MeV is given off in the decay.
So if a student looks up the mass of Radium in table A.3 and enters
M<sub>Ra</sub> = 226 u rather than M<sub>Ra</sub> = 226.025402 u, we
need to turn that entry red.
<p>
One way to deal with this problem is to associate an accuracy with each given 
and each variable, especially each sought variable.
Givens could be assumed exact if given as 
integers and as having an accuracy of +- 1 in the last place given.
When calculating the problem solution the numbers would be considered
nearly exact, but when evaluating student numerical input, the specified
accuracy would be used. The problem with this is that in cases with
redundant givens (which I think we should be able to handle) such as
Exdr5a, a given needs to be specified to very high accuracy for consistency
in the problem solution stage, without implying that accuracy in the 
checking stage. Some new declaration would be required, say
(Sigfigs variable_name 3)
to show that the equation (= v (DNUM 5.18895738185 m/s)) should not
be interpreted to mean 12 significant figures are required in the 
student calculation. The same form could be used to specify the accuracy
required for each variable which is not a given. For them, we might use
3 significant figures as a default.
<p>
This would handle the issue of judging student equations of the form
var = numerical value (with units), but it doesn't handle other equations,
such as Bob's example where a student has plugging in a = 2.61 m/s^2 to
get &nbsp;
V2_x^2=v1_x^2+2*2.61m/s^2*d_x 
<br>
We have no direct way of knowing that 2.61 m/s is a substitution for
a_x, and whether that is a suitable value based on however he calculated
a_x.
<P>
   Now we could look at this expression and say 2.61 means 2.61 +- .01,
and see if the equation checks within the error bars.
The checker does not currently have this ability, but it would be easy
to add.  But if we do this, the equation will check with 2.61 or with
2.6 or with 2. .  How do we
know 2.61 is acceptible but the same equation with 2. isn't?
<P>
Even worse, if we declare this equation correct, the help system will
ask which equations it is based on. The dependence checker works on
linear independence of gradients, and the gradient here will have a
d_x component of 5.22 rather than the exact value of 2a_x. When the
exact equation's gradient is subtracted, we will be left with a small
number in the d_x component and zeroes for all others - will we know
enough to treat this as zero? This seems very problematic to me, as
we may well be dealing with a thousand components, so treating as zero
all numbers less than 0.01 will surely lead to spurious conclusions
of dependency. 
<P>
Perhaps this is enough to show that dealing with such equations will
require quite a bit of further work. In view of the fact that
we are trying in any case to discourage plugging in imprecise numbers
until the final evaluation anyway, we may then ask
whether we might not just leave it as is, with it
virtually impossible for the student to enter such equations, because
they need to enter numbers to roughly 11 digit accuracy!
