Kurt says:</h3>
When applying NSL, it is not necessary to draw a net force or define a
net force variable. However, students sometimes do it.&nbsp; Similarly,
when applying conservation of energy, student sometimes define variables
for total mechanical energy even though they could easily write the Law
in terms of a sum of individual energies instead.&nbsp; These are cases
of students making intermediate terms explicit even though they don't have
to.&nbsp; Here's the pedagogical policies I think Andes should follow:
<ul>
<li>
If students produce intermediate terms, then Andes should mark them correct.</li>

<li>
Whats-next help should not suggest that the students draw or define intermediate
terms.&nbsp; For instance, we don't want Andes to suggest drawing a net
force as part of NSL.&nbsp; Such drawings are often confusing to students,
because they haven't mastered the distinction between individual and net
forces.</li>

<li>
Suppose the student produces an incorrect version of an intermediate term
(e.g., draws a zero net force when the net force is actually zero, as <a href="../ErrorHandlers/ZeroNetForceWhenSpeedingUp.html#Karlton-Holston 35-57">one
student did</a>.).&nbsp; Andes could either recommend not bothering to
produce the term, or it could remedy the error.&nbsp; I think it should
remedy the error, because it is more important to learn the properties
of physical quantities than to learn the most efficient problem-solving
procedure.</li>
</ul>
One approach to implementing these policies is to include choices in the
PSM paths such that one choice defines a net force or other intermediate
term, and the other choice does not.&nbsp; The choice that does not define
the intermediate term is first, so that the whats-next help system will
prefer it whenever it has a choice.&nbsp; There may be other techniques
for achieving the same effect (e.g,. optional goals?) that need to be thought
through.
