Different measures of space</h2></center>

<i>Comments by Joel in italics</i>
<br>The Andes interface currently uses many different measures of space:
<ul>
<li>
vectors</li>

<ul>
<li>
displacement =change in position of a body over time</li>

<li>
relative position of different bodies at the same same time</li>
</ul>

<li>
scalars</li>

<ul>
<li>
height = position of a body at a time with respect to a zero point</li>

<li>
distance travelled by a body over time (i.e., path length)</li>

<li>
distance between two bodies</li>

<li>
radius of revolution</li>

<li>
width of a rectangle</li>

<li>
height of a rectangle</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Different principles use different quantities, of course.&nbsp; For instance,
gravitational potential energy uses height but kinematics uses displacement.&nbsp;
However, there are situations where some of these quantities are equal.&nbsp;
For instance, the magnitude of the relative position of a body with respect
to the ground <i>directly beneath it</i> at T0 is the same as the height
of the body at T0 given that the ground is the zero point.&nbsp; Andes2
does not currently have rules to assert equations for all such cases (neither
did Andes 1).&nbsp; This means that when a student enters one of the equivalent
quantities that is not the one that the rules use, it will be marked wrong.&nbsp;
For instance, if they draw a displacement vector when Andes is expecting
height, it will be colored red.
<p>There are three ways to handle this.&nbsp; One is to teach the students
Andes' conventions for which quantity to use with which principle.&nbsp;
For instance, when a student tries to draw a displacement on a problem
where the solution involves gravitational potential energy, Andes gets
them to agree that they should use PE then tells them that Andes wants
them to use height instead of displacement whenever they use the PE principle.&nbsp;
Clearly, student have enough to learn without learning Andes' conventions,
so this option is not the best.
<p>The second is to write rules in the KB that assert equations that equate
the different quantities whenever necessary.&nbsp; These equations generate
choices in the PSM paths.&nbsp; For instance, one choice is to define the
height using the height tool, and the other is to define it using the displacement
tool and by writing the equation that displacement is equal to height.&nbsp;
That equation would have to be marked as optional so that the student wouldn't
be forced to define a height variable and write it.&nbsp; This approach
also means that different paths for the PSM generate different sets of
primitive equations, which can cause combinatorial problems when generating
all sets of independent equations.&nbsp; Another problems occurs when one
of these kinds of quantities appears as a given or a sought.&nbsp; For
instance, if the problem states that the height is given and only height
appears in the equation for gravitational potential energy, then the equation
between displacement and height can be eliminated without effecting the
solvability of the equations.&nbsp; In general, if the student thinks that
quantity X appears in both the givens and the principles, but actually
it is an equivalent quantity Y, then I'm afraid that we will run into combinatorial
trouble or worse things.
<p>A third way to handle this is to reduce the number of definable quantities
to the minimal set, and create new dialog boxes for each.&nbsp; Here is
a minimal set:
<ul>
<li>
<b>relative position: From: &lt;body1, time-point1> To: &lt;body2, time-point2></b>.&nbsp;
This would be a vector drawing tool, like velocity or force.&nbsp; It covers
both displacement (where body1=body2) and the current version of relative
position (where timepoint1=timepoint2). Its magnitude covers height, if
we always define problems so that the zero point is occupied by a body,
<i>[
might we create a superclass of body, which is an abstract object with
a position and mass and capable of movement, to abstract just the position
attribute? Then a point can be referred to if anything is special about
it whether there is a body there or not. This concept might be useful in
referring to the ground, or the endpoint of a spring, as well, although
you seem to imply those are already bodies.]</i> such as the ground or
the top of a spring, at the appropriate time.&nbsp; It does not cover distance
travelled, but it does cover distance between two bodies.&nbsp; It covers
radius of revolution as long as we let the center of revolution be a body.
It covers the width and height of a rectangle only if we let the sides
be bodies.</li>

<li>
<b>path length: &lt;body> &lt;time-interval></b>.&nbsp; This covers the
old distance travelled.</li>
</ul>
This does not completely eliminate the problem, but it drastically reduces
it.&nbsp; For instance, if the problem required gravitational PE, then
the student could either draw the height or, if there happened to be an
object that moved in a straight line over the correct distance, then the
student could also use path-length as a second option..&nbsp; However,
in the current workbench, they can do both of those (using the relative
position tool and the distance-travelled tool) plus define a height variable
and maybe a variable for distance between two bodies.
<p>Indeed, if we eliminate the path-length tool and the problems that require
it, then there is only one way to for the user to specify the spatial measurements
on every problem. We would also use just one quantity inside the KB.
<i>In
addition to the unknown direction problem below, this would also force
the first-week student who is doing one-dimensional problems to draw vectors.
That is not necessarily a bad thing, as it makes more connected that material
and the later 2-D stuff, but it might present an added load on his learning
right at the start.</i>
<p>There is a small problem with the single-tool idea.&nbsp; On some problems,
the relative orientations of the begining and ending points are not specified.&nbsp;
Thus, the student can't know what direction to draw the vector.&nbsp; However,
this is currently true of the velocity tool as well.&nbsp; For instance,
on the problem where a firecracker is tossed in the air, the student must
draw a final velocity vector, but isn't given enough information to calculate
its direction.&nbsp; Thus, Andes accepts any direction as correct.&nbsp;
Similarly, when the problem doesn't specify enough information to easily
calculate the direction of the relative position, then Andes should accept
any direction as correct.
<i>It is not just the unknown direction, but
the arbitrary direction, which might be a problem. For example, the radius
could be defined as the magnitude of the relative position from the center
to ANY point on the rim, as well as vice-versa. Will we be having Andes
say Ok to one of these but not another?</i>
<p>This tool would allow students to solve the submarine and ship problem:&nbsp;
"A sub is 3000 m South of a ship which is moving in a known direction at
a known speed.&nbsp; The speed of the sub's torpedo's is known.&nbsp; What
angle should it shoot the torpedo and how long will it take to reach the
ship?"&nbsp; This problem requires defining the relative position of the
ship vs. the sub at T0, the ship at T0 vs. T1, and the torpedo at T0 vs.
T1.&nbsp; The orientations of the latter two vectors are not easily calculated,
so Andes should accept anything for them.
<p>One drawback of going to the single-tool approach (besides the implementation
effort, which is considerable) is that it forces students to use one tool
for many conceptually distinct quantities.&nbsp; A radius is really not
displacement, but one uses the same tool for both.&nbsp; Students have
to understand the spatial concepts well enough to map them into the relative
position tool, and that includes learning the conventions for referring
to zero points and centers when wishing to define a height or a radius.
<p>On the other hand, as we extend Andes to cover more physics, we might
run into principles that are typically expressed in a spatial measurement
concept that we don't have in the system yet.&nbsp; If we use the multiple-tool
approach, where height, displacement, etc. each has its own tool, then
we'd have to define a new tool for this new concept, and students would
have to learn how to use it.&nbsp; On the other hand, if we use the single-tool
approach, we don't need to change anything on the user interface and the
student's don't have to learn much new.
<p>The bottom line is that we can either use one tool for all spatial measurement
concepts and let students deal with mapping the concepts onto the tool,
or we can use many tools (one per concept) and deal internally with the
technical difficulties that equivalences create.&nbsp; We need the input
of experienced instructors on this design decision.
<br>&nbsp;
<i>It is my feeling that unifying displacement and relative
position is definitely a good idea, and that unification with lengths more
generally may be a good idea but I am not sure. - Joel</i>

Anders:</h3>
Another possibility that occurred to me would be to keep multiple equivalent
<br>ways of referring to the same spatial quantity in some cases where
it seems
<br>appropriate, but treat the equalities specially so they don't actually
<br>multiply the solution paths we find.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would be similar
to the method
<br>we used for eliminating equalities from the equation hash tables. We
pick a
<br>'canonical" quantity to use in the solutions, and use the equalities
only to
<br>allow us to map from the student's choice of quantity to the 'canonical"
one
<br>before checking their entries or equations.
<p>An example is how to define the radius for use in the equation v = omega
* r
<br>for determining the linear velocity of a point on a rotating object.
This
<br>quantity could equally well be specified as:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -the scalar radius of circular motion of the point.
(Axis is implicit in
<br>this!)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -the scalar distance between the point and the axis
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -the magnitude of the relative position vector to
the point from the
<br>axis
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -the magnitude of the relative position vector to
the axis from the
<br>point
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Currently, the preferred one on the interface is "radius", I believe.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The suggestion in this case would be to use one of these, say "radius",
as
<br>the 'canonical" quantity in the main section of the solution graph,
but also
<br>keep a segregated set of nodes containing the equivalences and the
steps
<br>that would be needed to generate them. Traversals to enumerate solution
<br>paths would ignore the segregated equivalence nodes.&nbsp; Checking
a variable or
<br>vector definition could look in both sections so that drawing a relative
<br>position vector would be allowed. Checking an equation would require
<br>replacing instances of "non-canonical" variables such as magnitude
of
<br>relative position with the equivalent "canonical" ones such as radius
before
<br>checking. One would have to map back in any message to the student
on the
<br>equation as well.
<p>Although there is a little bit of complexity in this approach, it might
give
<br>us the best of both worlds. Even though a radius is just a particular
sort
<br>of distance, I really think we want to keep this (or something like
it)
<br>since all the relevant formulas you see will be given in terms of a
radius
<br>"r" and we want to use standard terminology and notation where possible.
But
<br>use of the others should not be wrong, and it certainly strikes me
as highly
<br>desirable to reduce the number of little "gotchas" that result solely
from
<br>failure to recognize certain arbitrary conventions imposed by Andes
in the
<br>form of a solution.
<p>By the way, I don't think we would want *all* equivalences between
<br>quantities to be treated this way. In particular those equivalences
between
<br>force magnitudes that result from Newton's Third Law seem to involve
special
<br>physics knowledge on which we might have to tutor and so constitute
steps
<br>that we would expect to be explicitly written. There might be others
like
<br>this.
<p>We might use special rules with distinguishable output forms to handle
cases
<br>where we deem the equivalence to result from an arbitrary choice of
<br>equivalent quantities, so that the thing that builds the equality table
can
<br>distinguish them.

Kurt:</h3>
Anders, thanks for the suggestion about how to implement the multiple-tools
approach.&nbsp; The key issue, though, is whether it is better for students
to see one general-purpose spatial measurement tool, or many special purpose
tools?&nbsp; You seem to be leaning toward the multiple-tool side, on the
grounds that students are taught to use special symbols like "r" and concepts
like "radius."&nbsp; Note that they can still use special symbols for the
variable names.&nbsp; The only difference is whether they see alot of different
names (e.g., Radius, Compression distance, Displacement, etc.) in the variables
menu or a single name (e.g., Spatial measure).
<p>By the way, I was planning on using your technique to handle the cases
where the student defines a variable for "the height of the hill" when
Andes wants "the height of the roller coaster."&nbsp; The current system
gives them an error message.&nbsp; Andes 2 should instead mark the student's
variable definition as correct, but map it internally to the preferred
quantity.&nbsp; This trick is independent of the single-tool vs. multiple-tool
issue; it can be used with either one.
<h3>
Don &amp; Bob:</h3>
In an email and a later phone call (4/5/01), they would prefer that Andes
use the spatial measurement tools that it has now.&nbsp; The main reason
is that the students will be quite confused and lost if they open up the
tools and don't see Distance, Displacement, and the other terms that their
textbook uses.&nbsp; Even when they are confronted with multiple ways to
measure the same thing (e.g,. height of car vs. height of hill vs. distance
from ground to hill), they would prefer that the student just pick one
and get green (not red) feedback.&nbsp; So we will have to implement Anders'
equivalence classes.
