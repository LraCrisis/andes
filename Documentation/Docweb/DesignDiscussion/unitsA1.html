<h2>Form of unit expressions in communications with algebra module</h2>

In the givens in our problem statements we have been writing the units
expressions as unstructured symbols drawn from a short list. For example:

     (given (at (mag (accel crate)) 1) (dnum 1.25 m/s^2))

If we include the units in the equations, this would most naturally give
rise to the same notation in solution equations sent to your code:

    (= a_Crate_1 (dnum 1.25 m/s^2))

I think this is a highly natural and readable form for a problem author to
use. I'm wondering if this will pose any difficulty for the algebra module.
To handle these the algebra checker would have to map unit specifications in
this form, e.g. the string of characters "kg*m^2/s", into whatever
structured thingy it uses internally to represent units.

This may look like a string parsing problem but it really isn't. The strings
filling the units position may appear to have structure but in fact they are
just Lisp symbols -- Lisp is more liberal than most programming languages
about the characters allowed in identifiers.  That means one couldn't use
parentheses for grouping inside these identifiers. And I'm not sure if the
usual precedence rules for arithmetic operators are observed inside them;
there may just be conventional parsings associated.

Since there's a finite list of the things to match, and you can know -- at
least when getting a well-formed equation from *us* -- where in the
expression the unit string part begins and ends, it really only requires a
table lookup.

Of course someone will have a unit parsing problem in the strings the
student sends us. I expect we want to allow the student to enter unit names
in a very similar form. So Linwood's parse, at least will ultimately have to
handle input like this. As you know, the Andes1 parser just used a list of
accepted unit names -- it can be viewed in

    T:\\Vanlehn\Andes\lisp\Equation\consts.lsp (search for *units*).

When we last spoke you were suggesting that when sending you the units for
variables, we pass you an easy-to-parse Lisp-expression-y representation of
units like
    (/  (* kg m) (^ s 2))
I started to put them into our table in this fashion. But it occurs to me
now we ought to use the same form of unit expression in the givens and
equations as for the variables.

If it is more convenient for communicating with your code, then we could
always just continue to use the unit name strings as they exist in the
problem statements and just do the mapping from unit symbols to unit
expression trees on the Lisp side before sending the equations to you. Such
a substitution would require only an alist and one function call in Lisp.
Though it would reduce the readability of the equation file a bit to have
these structured units in them.

Anyway, please think about this and then we can discuss the options.
