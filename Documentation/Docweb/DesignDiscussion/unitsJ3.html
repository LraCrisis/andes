Anders,
   Of course it would be very easy for me to get units from you by
exact string match to a preexisting list of units, and maybe, if this
is what is going to hold us up, that is how we should proceed for now.
But as a real solution I think it is a bad idea, because it means that
every new problem has a chance of breaking the system because it uses
a set of units not previously encountered. It also requires the
maintenance of a symbol table accessible both to your code and to the
algebra system, a table which may have frequent modifications.
   In addition, we need a parser for units anyway, to input the student
code. This is what will be the real headache - if you can parse student
ill-formed units you can surely parse well formed units from the help
system and SGG generator.
   Now as for how units should be presented, lisp style prefix was your
idea, not mine, and I can handle any sensible, well defined grammar, I
think. So I think you should continue to use m/s^2, which is well formed,
but not m/s2, which is not.
   By the way, what I see in CONSTS.LSP has ony 23 combinations, including
English ones, and many duplicates, not only not including the units for
viscosity and electric field but not even Watts. And while it has Nm it
doesn't have mN or kg.m^2/s^2, which are equivalent ways even a professor
might define things. (by the way, kg*m^2*rad/s is not a "correct"
expression. 1 m * 1 rad/s = 1 m/s --- sorry, but velocity is not measured
in m rad/s even though v = omega r.)

If we are going to go with a table, temporarily or not, may I suggest we
work with well formed acceptable ones. The list I gave Linn did not
include the fundamental ones
   m  kg  s  g
It had
   A  C  N  J  K  V  T  Wb  ohm  Hz  Pa  F  H  W  m/s  m/s^2  N.m  J.s
   kg.m^2  N/m  N.s/m^2  N/m^2
I hadn't intended to include all combinations, so if we do need such a
list we need to add at least
   kg*m^2/s
We haven't agreed to allow in English units and how to do so, and I think
doing so should be postponed. (Are there any quantitative problems used at
usna in English units?).  deg and rad are a serious ontological problem
which will need to be resolved somehow, but for the time being, lets
accept both deg and rad but recall that when either of these are
multiplied by m there are special rules:
	1 m  x  1 rad/s  = 1 m/s
	1 m  x  1 deg/s  =  0.01745329251994329 m/s
