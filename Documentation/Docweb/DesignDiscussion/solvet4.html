What Should the Solve Tool Do?, Part 4
</h2>
<h3>Joel's recollections of discussion with Don at the USNA on June 12</h3>
<h3>and some phone calls shortly before that</h3>
<P>

<P>
On May 24'th, in the spirit that we needed to get something working and
should put aside all optional features, Joel announced:
<UL><LI>   In that spirit I will also start working on implementing
a solvetool which only tries to give a numerical answer for
a requested variable (dumb genie). I will then try to allow
parameters in the answers. This is what I called the genie.
The explicative genie will have to wait.
The superevaluator is the first part of the dumb genie,
so I could easily make this available separately.</UL>
</P><P>
The solve-tool invoked by a right mouse click in an equation box
was implemented to provide dumb genie support, but in fact also
solves problems with parameters in the answer, such as Exs4a.
</P><P>
In our meeting on June 12, Don asked that the alternate solve tool
"for engineers" be implemented. This tool enables the student to select 
an equation and 
a variable within it, and solve for that variable, and then select 
other equations and have that solution substituted in (and simplified).
The algebra system now has this capability as
two separate calls, but there are not yet hooks in the workbench to
trigger them.
</P><P>
Also at that meeting, Don and Joel discussed the "calculate" or
simplify equation tool. We decided to plug all numerical assignment 
statements from elsewhere, recursively, into the selected equation, and
simplify. This has now been implemented.
