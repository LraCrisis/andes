What Should the Solve Tool Do?, Part 2

<P>
For equation manipulation tools:
<P>
1.  Calculate answers arithmetically.  This tool checks that the student 
has correctly entered all the equations necessary to calculate all the 
answers.  If so, then it just enters the answers in the appropriate answer 
boxes.  If not, then it says, "You have not yet entered enough equations to 
calculate all the answer.  You can ask for 'what's next' help (the light 
bulb button) to get a suggestion for what to do next."
<P>

2. Transform & Substitute & DoArithmetic.  This design has a suite of 3 tools:
<P>
A.  Transform applies only when a correct equation is selected.  It asks 
the student to select a variable in the equation (from a menu it offers), 
then transforms the equation to the form &lt;selected variable&gt; = 
&lt;expression&gt;.    Thus, Transform(a1) on T1-m1*g = m1*a1 causes andes to 
write a1 = (T1-m1*g)/m1 in the next open box of the equation window.
<P>
B.  Substitute applies only when a correct equation is selected and it has 
the form &lt;variable&gt;=&lt;expression&gt;.  For each variable X in the &lt;expression&gt; 
such that there exists a correct equation in the student's window of the 
form X=&lt;expr&gt;, it replaces X with the &lt;expr&gt;.  This is done 
recursively.  Thus, the equation will be left in the form 
&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;expression&gt; where &lt;expression&gt; either has no variables X that 
have equations of the form X=&lt;expression&gt; except for &lt;variable&gt;.  More 
specifically, suppose the student selects a1=(T1-m1*g)/m1 when the other 
equations are T2-m2*g=-m2*a2, T1=T2 and a2=a1.  Substitute pops up a dialog 
box saying "no substitutions can be made.  You need to convert some 
equations to the form &lt;variable&gt;=&lt;expression&gt; using the Transform 
tool."  Suppose the student now applys Transform(T2) to  T2-m2*g=-m2*a2 and 
gets T2 =  -m2*a2-m2*g.  The student next applys Substitute to 
a1=(T1-m1*g)/m1 and gets a1 = ((-m2*a1-m2*g)-m1*g)/m1.  The student next 
applies Transform(a1) to this and gets a1 = (-m2*g-m1*g)/(m1+m2).
<P>
C.  DoArithmetic applies only when a correct equation of the form 
&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;expression&gt; is selected.  It does any arithmetic possible in 
the &lt;expression&gt;, including calling trig functions.
<P>

3.  Solve via substitution.  This tool applies only when the student has 
selected a correct equation.  It asks the student to select a variable in 
the equation (from a menu it offers), then applies the tools described 
above in the following sequence: Transform(X), Substitute, Transform(X), 
DoArithmetic, where X is the variable that the student selected.  This will 
transform the equation to the form X=&lt;expression&gt; where &lt;expression&gt; is as 
simple as possible, given that substitutions can only be done when the 
student has an equation of the form &lt;variable&gt;=&lt;expression&gt; already.
<P>

4. Solve via substitution and transformation.  This tool applies only when 
the student has selected a correct equation.  It asks the student to select 
a variable in the equation (from a menu it offers), then applies 
Transform(X), Substitute and Transform(X) to the equation, where X is the 
variable that the student selected.  This transforms the equation to the 
form X=&lt;expression&gt; where &lt;expression&gt; has no variables that have equations 
of the form &lt;variable&gt;=&lt;expr&gt; written in the equation window.  However, 
&lt;expression&gt; may have variables in it that appear in equations in the 
window but those equations don't have the variable on the left side.  If 
&lt;expression&gt; has such variables, it Transforms their equations and repeats 
the Transform(X), Substitute, and Transform(X) process.  Again, we get an 
&lt;expression&gt; that might have variables that are contained in equations that 
need to be transformed.  So the cycle repeats until there are no such 
variables in the resulting &lt;expression&gt;.  When it is all done, it applies 
DoArithmetic.  This is approximately what Andes1 did.  It cannot solve some 
systems of equations.   The algebraic equation solver that Andes2 uses is 
considerably more powerful.
