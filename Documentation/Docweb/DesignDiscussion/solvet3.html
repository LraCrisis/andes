Notes on plans for the solve-tool
</P><P>
The solve-tool is intended to provide the student with help in
doing the algebraic and arithmetic manipulations of her correct
equations so as to derive solutions for some of the physical 
variables. Today, Kurt, Anders and I, at Pitt, and Bob, Don, Kay 
and Mary at USNA, had a conference call discussion of what the 
solve-tool should do. This note is intended to summarize and
clarify what we discussed.
</P><P>
Because there is confusion on terminology, let me define terms
here.
<UL><LI>
    A <B>variable</B> (or physical variable) is any symbol representing
        a known or unknown physical quantity, as it is usually
        in algebra. Pi and e are not a variables, and possibly in the
        future G and c won't be either.
    <LI>
     a <B>numval</B> (numerical value) is an explicit number with possible 
        units. Thus 5 kg, Pi radians, 9.8 m/s^2, 30 deg, are
        all numvals. So is a dimensionless number if it is explicit.
    <LI>
    a <B>numasgn</B> (numerical assignment statement) is an equation of the 
        form <I>variable = numval</i> . 
	I previously called these assignments, but
        need to be clearer now
    <LI>
    a <B>symbasgn</B> (symbolic assignment statement) is a statement of the
        form variable = expression in other variables, 
        not including the variable on the left, which is called the
        substitutable variable.
    <LI>
    an <B>assignment</B> is either a numasgn or a symbasgn.
    <LI>
    an <B>equation solvable for a variable</B> v_i is one which can be 
        legitimately rewritten as a symbasgn for v_i, using only
        that equation and the rules of algebra. We will call doing so
    <LI><b>isolating the variable</b> v_i in the equation. [Note that not all 
        equations, not even all our simple ones, are solvable
        for variables they contain. Even x^2=9 is not solvable
        unless we have additional information on the sign of x.]
<LI>
    a <B>substitution</B> of an assignment v_i = f({v_j}) into an equation
        is a replacement of v_i everywhere it occurs in that equation
        by f({v_j}), followed by elementary simplification (I admit
        this is somewhat vague).
<LI>
    a <B>parameter</B> is a variable explicitly so declared, whose value cannot
        be determined from the information in the problem. Problem
        solutions may, if necessary, be expressed as algebraic 
        expressions in such parameters. In a problem with several
        parameters, they must be independent.
<LI>
    a <B>solution to the problem</B> is a set of values for each of the
        variables, either explicit numvals or expressions in the
        parameters only.
<LI>
    a <B>given</B> is a variable whose value is explicitly given in the problem
        statement and the defprob.
<LI>
    a <B>sought</B> is a variable whose value is asked for in the problem
        statement. Note this use conflicts with that in the help
        system, because we are not having current soughts.
<LI>
    <B>the student's equations</B> is the set of CORRECT equations entered
        into the equation slots or appearing in the upper left
        as a result of defining a direction or magnitude of a vector.
<LI>
    <B>recursive assignment</B> is the process of making all possible 
        substitutions of numasgns into all other equations, then 
        doing elementary simplification on these equations, checking
        to see if any have now become numasgns. If so, the procedure
        is repeated until there are no numasgns left. Roughly half
        the problems we have now can be solved by recursive 
        assignment on the equations generated by the SGG.
<LI>
    a <B>linear equation</B> is one which may contain any number of variables,
        but they occur only as terms, with possible numval 
        coefficients, in a sum. Thus W=m*g is not linear, but 
        W = m*9.8 m/s^2 is. We really should allow the coefficients
        to include parameters, but right now I do not have code to
        treat this case.
</UL>
Here are the tools we discussed:
<UL><LI>
    <B>the genie:</b> Checks if the student's equations are sufficient to 
        solve for the sought variable. If so, it gives the 
        solution without explanation. If not? Of course we can say, as
        Kurt suggested, "You have not yet entered enough equations to 
        calculate all the answer.  You can ask for 'what's next' help 
	(the light bulb button) to get a suggestion for what to do next."
	But does the solvetool need to provide specific info to the help
	system to answer that? <br>
      This is what Kurt called A in his 5/16 email. We decided this should
        be available, at least for the Humanities students.  
<LI>
    <B>the explicative genie:</b> (I think this is Kurt's D)<br>
	The student selects a variable to solve for.
	If the student's equations are adequate, it first solves for the
	variable in terms of the parameters and variables which are givens,
	without substituting numerical answers, and then substitutes these
	in, and finally simplifies. Not clear what he suggested in the case
	that the equations were incomplete.
<P>
      The idea that we would first return an algebraic expression for the
	answer and then a numerical answer was warmly greeted (although the
	intermediate result's value was questioned). 
<P>      My problem with this is that I don't think I can do it, at least
        not in any timely fashion. We could try to use Maple again, as
        this is what Maple is good for. My solver worked better than Maple
	in getting full solutions for the problem because it plugged in 
	numerical values whereever it could. But we could try to get an
	answer from Maple and return it if it succeeded.
<P>      For Kurt's example (corrected a1=a2, signs reversed in answers)
	it would not be too hard to get the answer a1=(m2*g-m1*g)/(m1+m2),
	because in this case the heuristic of "solve for a variable which
	is neither sought nor given and plug in everywhere, and recurse"
	will give the answer. But if we have nonlinear functions this 
        might lead to exponential blowups.
<LI><B>the slave:</B> 
        Asks student to select an equation and a variable solvable
        therein, and a target equation. This was Kurt's B. It 
     <UL><LI>            isolates the variable in the first equation.
         <LI>   makes the substitution of that assignment in the target
            equation.
         <LI>   simplifies the resulting equation (making it a numasgn 
            if possible). </UL>
        If desired, these steps could be separated. This is Kurt's C.
	<P>
	  If we implement this B tool, we need to ask whether it puts the 
            result of the first step in an unused slot, and where it puts the
            the final rewriting of the target equation.
<P>
      I tried to push this B option, but it didn't 
        get much support. C got even less. The advantages are 
   <UL><LI>    1) the student is completely aware of the what is being done,
               and is in charge.
       <LI>     2) the algebra system should not have trouble doing these
               steps, even with substituting complicated expressions, though
               its simplifications might not always be adequate.
	       </UL>
<LI><B>the evaluator:</B> Asks the student to select an equation, and then
        takes all numasgns for any variable in that equation and
        makes the substitution. Then simplifies. We would like
        it if the student only used this when the result will be
        a numasgn.
<LI><B>the superevaluator:</B> takes all numasgns and plugs them into all
        other equations, simplifying, if possible to numasgns.
        If this produces any new numasgns, it recurses.<br>
      I think there was support for this.
</UL>
