   <h2 align=center>Early discussion of need for Units in Andes</h2>
   <h3 align=center>Joel</h3>

On August 25, 2000, I sent an note introducing myself to Bob Shelby. 
Here is an extract from that message:
<p>
... I did wonder about a few points which I find objectionable,
and wonder how the physicists actually using this stuff
feel about it.
<p>
    1) Andes completely ignores units. Most instructors
of introductory physics I know make a big point of requiring
units in answers, but even more importantly, in using units
to check on the validity of equations written down. Not to
mention using dimensional analysis.
