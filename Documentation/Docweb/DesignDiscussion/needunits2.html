   <h2 align=center>Discussion in December on the need for units</h2>
   <h3 align=center>Joel</h3>

On Dec. 12, 2000, I sent to all the Andes folk, at Pitt and usna,
a message on my observations on the use of units in the Andes1 log files.
It is given here with comments Kurt made in reply interspersed in italics:
<p>
Notes on units in variables/equations in Andes
<p>
We have, I believe, agreed that the new version of Andes should
treat units seriously, so I am beginning to try to incorporate them
in the parsing. I have looked at the log files which Anders has
cleaned up for me, and examined the first 112 equations which involved
or should have involved units, and classified them as follows
 
<center><table><tr><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD> num/112 </TD></TR> 
<TR><TD>A:</TD><TD> assignment statements with correct units, 
eg G=9.8 m/s^2 </TD>
<TD> 59</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>B:</TD><TD> assignment statements with correct units even though 0</TD>
<TD> 3</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>C:</TD><TD> units included where they should not have been, eg </TD>
<TD> 1</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> </TD><TD> ag=(vp_y-vj_y)/(t1-t0)m/s^2</TD>
<TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>D:</TD><TD> assignment statements with units missing,
 eg Fw_y = -98 </TD>
<TD> 34</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>E:</TD><TD> units omitted when number plugged into equation </TD>
<TD> 10</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> </TD><TD>        eg.   -29.4 + Ft_y = 3 * ag_y </TD>
<TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>F:</TD><TD> units left off when quantity is 0 </TD>
<TD> 5</TD></TR></table></center>
<p>
I propose we accept A, B and F, and clearly we want to not accept
C and D (C comes from a misconception that the variables are numbers
associated with the physical quantities rather than the quantities
themselves, including units). The one situation which is not completely
clear is E - it is wrong, but we all do it in the course of doing our
algebra, hopefully restoring the units at the end. But I think we might
do well to be strict here, because
<UL><LI>         1) it will be hard for novices to remember when they are
                 using shorthand by dropping the units and when they
                 really aren't there   </LI>
<LI>         2) the extra pain of writing units when plugging values into
                 an equation will encourage them not to do that, which
                 we want to do anyway.</li>

<i>This is a strong point, in my opinion. </i>

<LI>         3) it will be hard to check units in equations if they are left
                 off.</LI>
<LI>         4) we should be reluctant to mark correct things which are not
                 really correct.</LI></UL>
<p>
So, I propose we accept A, B, F and mark C,D, and E wrong. (Accepting
F makes my life harder, but no physicist would object to v=0 as a legitimate
statement).
<p>
Grammar:
<p>
         A quantity involving units should begin with a number,
followed without an initial * by a composite of the symbols<br>
         m, kg, s, N, J, K, C, mol, V, A, T, ohm, Wb, Hz, Pa, F, H, W
         eV, MeV, c, u<br>
         and prefixes a f p n mu m c  k M G T P E<br>
         ( I left out d, h da, which are almost never used except for dl,
         which we would write as 10^{-4} m^3. c is used only with cm, as
         we shouldn't accept cc's anyway (cc = 10^{-6}m^3)<br>
    what about general non-SI:<br>
           Angstrom, atm, f (=fm), barn, cal, ^oC, lightyear, liter<br>
         English and other archiac units<br>
           Btu,  ^oF, ft, in, hr, min, hp, lb, day, yr, yd, mi, gal, oz,
           slug,<br>
         CGS: G (gauss), g gram, dyne, erg, bar, Kwh<br>
These symbols can be combined with or without *, with / and ^, but we
         need to know the rules: J/K mol = J/(K * mol), right?
<p>
I am not sure what the parsing rules should be. In assignment statements,
like I = 8 mA, it is easy, because once you hit a number followed by a
symbol without an intervening operator you can permanantly switch to
unit gathering. But if we allow quantities in equations, how do I know<br>
         P = 8 V * mA is 8 mW rather than 8 volts times the mass of A?
<p><i>
As I recall, Joel Martin's parser tried to parse units that appeared in the 
middle of equations, and as a consequence had to report multiple parses for 
some equations.  That would be very difficult to deal with.  However, we 
have several parsing experts in the NLT group, so we could whip up a simple 
parser pretty easily and test it on your corpus of student equations.

<h3> Bob Shelby's response:</h3>

On Dec 19, Bob sent to me, Treacy, and Mary, this note
<p>
Subject: Re: units for quantities
<p>
Joel,
<p>
We agree with almost everything that you have suggested.  Certainly there is no
need to
discuss your choice of marking A, B and F as correct.  We would prefer that
quantities that
have a zero value be allowed to have no units assigned.  We also agree that C
and D responses
should be marked as incorrect.
<p>
Our discussion of D led to a suggestion by Don that we would like to have you
consider.
Don's suggestion was motivated by the fact that the units on the two sides of
any physical
equation should match.  So, perhaps we should have a block on the right hand
side of each
line in the equation pane where the appropriate units for this equation line
are entered.  the
exception to this would be symbolic equations.
<p>
While we agree that it is often good practice for students to put units into
every term in
an equation, the reality is that when one has an equation like<br>
<center>
    V1_x^2 = V1_x^2 + 2*a_x*d_y
</center><br>
putting in complete units into each term becomes cumbersome.  We would settle
for having the
students designate the correct units for each side of the equation and in the
answer.  We also feel
that having unit checks in the equation pane is one requirement that could be
removed as the
student progresses.
<p>
We really do like the idea of adding unit checks!
<p>
These are our thoughts after a quick look during our final exam preparation.
More later.
<p>

<h3> Some misunderstandings about the above</h3>
I apparently misunderstood what Bob said, thinking he wanted units 
attached to variables in equations, not just numbers, but that is not
what he meant. For completeness, here is the followup, but it just resolves
that mixup on my part.

Actually, I think we disagree on units more than you think. My
understanding of units is such that the equation<center>
     V1_x^2 = V1_x^2 + 2*a_x*d_y</center>
is correctly written as is - all the units are there in V1 and a
and d. It would be superfluous to add units to either side. That is
why I stated that<br><br>

was wrong (which you agree with)
<p>
While it might be useful to have the student specify the units of
his equation, so that if he wrote<br>
        F = m v   [kg m/s^2]   we would ask him to check the rhs,<br>
but     F = m v   [kg m/s]  we would ask how a force can have such units,<br>
I doubt that it is worth the effort for the student. More importantly,
I don't think that should relieve the student of the responsibility
of giving units in the right place in<br><center>
        v = 8.0 m/s</center><br>
It is important that the student realize that v is not equal to 8,
even if that is what you punch into your calculator.    If it is placed
in a box like a comment to be checked (perhaps) later, this essential
coupling of the number with units is lost.
<p>

<p>
I probably didn't express myself very clearly.  We only suggested that units be
required in equations where values had been inserted.  If a student wrote
<center>
    F = m*v
</center>
his would be a purely symbolic equation where units would not be required.
However, we certainly think that the entry
<center>
    V = 8.00
</center>
should include proper units.  Our comments about the "V^2" equation referred to
a situation where numerical values had been put in for all of the known terms 
in the equation.  Here our suggestion might result in
<center>
    4^2 = 2^2 + 2*a_x*10     [m^2/s^2].
</center>
If fact we would prefer that the students jump directly from the symbolic 
equations plus given inputs(with correct units) to the final result.
<p>
Of course, what we have suggested might not work!
