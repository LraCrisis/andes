I vote for having the authors (e.g., Anders) use m/s^2, having Linn parse
them into (/ (^ s 2) m) at some point (not clear where), storing them in
the solution graph in the parsed form, and sending them to Joel in the
parsed form.  The student's equation's units will be parsed, so it will
be easier to compare student equation to system equation if they both
have parsed units.
