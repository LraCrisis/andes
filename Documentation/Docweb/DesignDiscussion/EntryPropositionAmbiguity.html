Entry Proposition Ambiguity</h2></center>

<center>(as of 5/29/01)</center>

<p>What if the same entry proposition, such as (axis 37), is produced by
two different cognitive steps in the solution graph?&nbsp; When the student
enters such an object, do we have to disambiguate, that is, to find out
which cognitive step corresponds to the student's entry?&nbsp; This is
the plan recognition problem--a known hard problem in AI.&nbsp; Hopefully
we can work around it rather than implement a solution for it.
<p>There are two cases to worry about.&nbsp; Suppose cognitive steps S1
and S2 have the same Entry Proposition.
<ul>
<li>
The cognitive step's operator applications are equalp but not eq.&nbsp;
That is, if you cons the operator name onto the operator argument values,
then use Lisp Equalp to test for equality, they are equal.&nbsp; That is,
S1 and S2 came from the same operator applied to the same arguments.&nbsp;
They appear in different places in the solution graph (i.e., they are not
eq).&nbsp; This can occur, for instance, when a kinematics PSM and a NSL
PSM both draw the acceleration of a body.</li>

<li>
The operator applications are not equalp.&nbsp; Thus, either they came
from application of different operators, or they came from application
of the same operator to different arguments.&nbsp; This can occur when
the same coordinate axes is drawn to allign with sought vectors on two
different bodies.</li>
</ul>
When a student makes an entry that is ambiguous (i.e., two or more cognitive
steps correspond to the student's Entry Proposition), then our basic approach
is to not try to decide which cognitive step was intended by the student.&nbsp;
This is the major reason for having two different data structures: Cognitive
Steps represent actions in their problem solving context, whereas System
Entries represent actions without their context.&nbsp; Thus, a System Entry
can point to two or more Cognitive Steps.&nbsp; The student's entry is
assigned a System Entry as its intepretation rather than a Cognitive Step.&nbsp;
Thus, we preserve the ambiguity and handle it later.&nbsp; There are multiple
places where ambiguity must be handled, and the rest of this page discusses
them.&nbsp; For convenience, suppose that a System Entry corresponds to
two cognitive steps, S1 and S2.
<p>If the student's entry corresponds to that System Entry (i.e., the student's
action is correct), then both S1 and S2 <a href="../SolutionGraph.html#Entering">get
marked as done by the Solution Graph module</a>.&nbsp; Thus, when What's
Next&nbsp; help is <a href="../NextStepHelp.html">walking the graph in
order to find a target step</a>, it will not pick an cognitive step that
has already been done even if it was done "for another purpose."&nbsp;
This is exactly the right thing to do in the cases mentioned above (e.g.,
same vector drawn for two different PSMs; same axes drawn for different
soughts).&nbsp; When Next Step help is deciding which branch of an unordered
And the student is working on, and S1 is one of the branches, then it will
interpret that branch as done or in progress, rather than "not started."
<p>If the student deletes a correct entry, then both S1 and S2 will be
<a href="../SolutionGraph.html#Deleting">unmarked as done by the Solution
Graph module</a>.&nbsp; This is exactly the right thing to do in the cases
mentioned above.
<p>In <a href="../NextStepHelp.html">Next Step help module</a>, the preamble
walks the solution graph with the student in order to arrive at a cognitive
step that the student should do.&nbsp; This disambiguates everything relevant
to that walk.&nbsp; When it arrives at the cognitive step, it generates
the hint sequence for it from the operator application stored in the cognitive
step.&nbsp; This is exactly the right thing to do.&nbsp; So far, we have
lost no capabilities by avoiding disambiguation.&nbsp; The remaining case
cause trouble.
<p>In What's Wrong help, <a href="../WhatsWrongHelp.html#Ambiguous bottom out hints">bottom
out hints</a> need to be generated specially when an intended student entry
is ambiguous.&nbsp; This is not a big deal, and it should rarely occur.
<p><a NAME="eq entry propositions have eq pre-reqs"></a>It is possible
for S1 and S2 to have different prerequisites. For instance, in a translational
kinematics problems, there are usually multiple kinematics PSMs that can
be applied, and the same quantities occur in muliple PSM, so the same projection
equations appear in multiple PSMs.&nbsp; The physicists want students to
write the compo equation for the PSM before writing any of its projection
equation.&nbsp; Thus, the same projection equation will have different
prerequisites depending on which PSM its in.&nbsp; For instance, the projection
equation for acceleration along the x-axis appears in both the vf^2=vi^2+2*a*s
PSM and in the s=vi*t+0.5*a*t^2 PSM.&nbsp; One projection will have vf_x^2=vi_x^2+2*a_x*s_x
as a prerequisite and the other will&nbsp; have s_x=vi_x*t+0.5*a_x*t^2
as its prerequisite.&nbsp; This means that the <a href="../EntryInterpreter.html">Entry
Interpreter cannot give specific advice when students have violated a prerequisite</a>.&nbsp;
It can only advise them to seek next-step help.&nbsp; For instance, if
the student has not yet written either vf_x^2=vi_x^2+2*a_x*s_x or s_x=vi_x*t+0.5*a_x*t^2
or any other compo version of a kinematics equation, then Andes should
tell the student that the projection equation is premature but it should
not tell the student which one to write.&nbsp; That is a strategic choice
that the student should make, perhaps with the aid of next-step help.&nbsp;
In order to do this, the Prerequisites field of the system entry is a list
of lists of system entries.&nbsp; That is, ((E1 E2)(E3 E4 E5)) means that
prerequisites are satisfied if either E1 and E2 are done, or E3, E4 andE5
are done.&nbsp; This is really not correct, because prerequisites might
be satisified for one cognitive step (say, the one that requires E1 and
E2) whereas the student's intention is to write the other cognitive step
(which has E3, E4 and E5 as prerequisites) and its prerequisites might
not be satisfied yet.&nbsp; However, in this rather odd case, the student
will be allowed to continue unmolested.&nbsp; Not a terrible consequence.
<p><a NAME="correctness order"></a>S1 and S2 may not have the same correctness.&nbsp;
In this case, the Entry Interpreter should react to the "most correct"
of the operator applications.&nbsp; The correctness order is: Correct >
inefficient > incorrect > dead-path > forbidden.&nbsp; When the <a href="../SolutionGraphGenerator.html">solution
graph generator is building the system entry index</a>, it computes the
correctnes of the system entry from the correctness of the cognitive steps
that correspond to it.&nbsp; Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>
If S1 is forbidden and S2 is correct, then the student should have their
entry treated as a correct entry.&nbsp; On the other hand, if all op apps
are forbidden, then the student has gone down a forbidden path, so they
get warned and the entry is deleted.</li>

<li>
If S1 is on a dead-path and S2 is correct, then the student should have
their entry treated as a correct entry.&nbsp; In the scenario just mentioned,
if the student draws a weight vector, then even though it is ambiguous,
it should be colored green.&nbsp; If all the op aps are all on dead-paths,
then the student had clearly ventured down a dead path.&nbsp; Feedback
doesn't tell the student about dead-path entries, but What's wrong help
and next-step help does.</li>

<li>
If S1 is correct but on an inefficient path and S2 is correct and efficient,
then the student's entry should be treated as if it were correct and efficient.&nbsp;
Feedback doesn't tell the student about inefficient entries, but What's
wrong help and next-step help do.</li>
</ul>
