How much physics knowledge should be involved in modification-base error
analysis?</h2></center>

Kurt:</h3>
Many errors can be interpreted by modifying the student's entry until it
is correct.&nbsp; The issue discussed here is whether Andes should searhc
through all syntactically legal modifications or whether it should only
make knowledge-based modifications, namely, ones that have some kind of
knowable hint associated with them.
<p>Andes1 explored all syntactically legal modifications of the student
entries that created correct entries.&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp; it would
often have no help associated with a modification after it had found it.&nbsp;
This caused it to give strange advice that ended up in a bottom out hint
that made no sense but yielded a correct action.&nbsp; Students probably
learned little from following this advice.
<p>The first redesign was to specify a more limited range of modifications
that could be applied to entries.&nbsp; For non-equations, it was simply
changing an incorrect value for a slot into a correct value.&nbsp; For
instance, if the student entered a net force that had zero magnitude and
was for time T0, then the modification would be to change its time specifier
to during(T0,T1), its magnitude to non-zero and its direction to the correct
direction. For student equations, the modifications were inserting negative
signs, swapping one variable for an other of similar type, restoring missing
forces in a sum of forces, etc.&nbsp; An analysis of errors based on this
scheme is found <a href="../OldErrorClassification/Errors.html">here</a>.
<p>The advantage of this scheme is that it would identify an interpretation
(a set of correct operator applications corresponding to the student's
entry) in a wide variety of cases.&nbsp; Even if the modification was unfamiliar
to Andes, it could still give what's-wrong help based on the interpretation.&nbsp;
This was particularly useful for non-equation entries, because they often
had just one op ap as their interpretation, so there was no uncertainty
about which op ap to hint.&nbsp; Whever we could identify a singleton interpretation
for an error, we can use the next-step hint sequences that already exist
on the operator to give whats-wrong hints.
<p>However, it turned out that just giving the next-step hints associated
with an op ap produced confusing whats-wrong hints.&nbsp; The next-step
hint sequences try to get a student to notice the conditions needed to
apply the op, then teach the op.&nbsp; The what-wrong hint sequence should
assume that student already did the op and needs help correcting one of
its slots.&nbsp; Because the goals and context of the hint sequences were
different, different hint sequences were necessary.&nbsp; In fact, for
each different modification required to match the student's entry to the
op ap, a different hint sequence was needed because it would mention the
slot that was wrong.
<p>Then it was noticed that the same hint sequences would appear for the
same modification (e.g,. the time specifier slot) but different op aps
(e.g., velocities vs. durations).&nbsp; For instance, the hint "The time
specifier of &lt;quantity> should be the same as the time specifier of
&lt;method>" was the same for many quanitites and many PSMs.&nbsp; Clearly,
duplication could be avoided by associating the what's wrong hint sequences
with the type of modification, rather than the op ap.&nbsp; That is essentially
what error handlers do.
<p>That is, an error handler recognizes errors by maodifying the students
entry in a particular way and seeing if that modification makes the entry
correct.&nbsp; Error handlers can be very general (e.g., any sign error
in an equation) or very specific (e.g., a sign error due to not drawing
a decelerating object's acceleration vector).&nbsp; The error handlers
must be ordered so that specific error handlers get a chance to apply before
general ones.&nbsp; Clearly, we do not lose any coverage compared to the
other scheme, because we can add some very general error handlers that
have the same coverage as the general modifications used in the first redesign.&nbsp;
Whether we have anything smart to say in such cases is an open issue.&nbsp;
If we don't, then it is best to say nothing and let the default whats-wrong
help (= next-step help) respond.
<p>The main disadvantage of error handlers is that they include much of
the same knowledge as appears in the operators, but they are not associated
with the operators in the same nice way that next-step hints are.&nbsp;
When a domain author changes the operators, the error handlers should be
changed too, but it is easy to forget to update the them if they are in
a different place.&nbsp; This suggests that the error handlers should be
added only after the operator KB is mature and unlikely to change.&nbsp;
Maybe someday we can link the two KBs.
<p>In short, we have gone from one extreme to the other in two hops:
<ul>
<li>
The Andes1 design was almost knowledge free.&nbsp; It's syntactic modifications
were often not associated with physics pedagogical knowledge, and they
were not generated from the op aps that were the interpretations of the
errors.</li>

<li>
The redesign has some knowledge.&nbsp; It still used syntatic modifications
to modify the student entries into correct entries.&nbsp; It tried to use
the next-step hints on the operators as its pedagogical knowledge, supplemented
with "a few" special cases for different modifications.&nbsp; But most
of the hint sequences turned out to be based on the modifications more
than the operators.</li>

<li>
The error handler design uses knowledge to both make the modifications
to the student equation and to generated the hint sequence.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the knowledge is decoupled from the operator KB, so care must be taken
synchonize them.</li>
</ul>
