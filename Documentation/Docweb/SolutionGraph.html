Big data structures</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b><a href="SolutionGraphDataStructure.html">Solution graph</a></b> --
comprises the bubble graph and a psm graph for each psm node in the bubble
graph.&nbsp; After this has been loaded, the only module that reads it
is the What's next help module.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Entry index"></a><b>Entry index</b> -- this is an array containing
the <a href="Base.html#System entry">system entries</a> for the whole solution
graph.&nbsp; It is used in delivering all the services of this module.&nbsp;
It is sorted so that the equation entries come first.&nbsp; Thus, the indices
into this index correspond to the indices used in the algebra module to
refer to equations.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Solution index"></a><b>Solution index</b> -- This is a list of
all solution sets, where a solution set is a list of system entry indices
for equations.&nbsp; The equations in a solution set are guaranteed (by
the solution graph generator) to be sufficient for solving the problem
and algebraically independent.&nbsp; This module loads the solution index
when it loads the solution grah, then it tells them to the algebra module.&nbsp;
After that, the solution sets are never accessed again by the Lisp code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Setup</h3>
When a problem is loaded into the help system it is necessary to load it
into the solutiongraph as well.&nbsp; This consists of two separate tasks.
<p>Firslty the problem's bubblegraph is searched for all instances of csdos
with systementry proposition within their effects.&nbsp; For each of these
a distinct systementry struct will be created or a preexisting identical
struct will be updated to include the entry.&nbsp; These entries will be
used later to reflect the state of the solution and to check for the correctness
of student entries.
<p>The second part of the process consists of setting up the solutions
themselves.&nbsp; This consists of sending the sets of base equations for
each solution to the algebra subsystem.&nbsp; These will be used later
to decompose student equations into their respective parts.
<h3>

<h3>
<a NAME="Search for match to entry"></a>Searching for a match to a student
entry</h3>
(Called from the Entry Interpreter.)&nbsp; Given a studententry struct
which can match either an equation or a non-equation entry find the system
entry/Entries that match it and return them along with their state.&nbsp;
Initially it was assumed that the functions for matching equation and non-equation
entries would be two separate calls.&nbsp; However it was found that, for
programmatic reasons the it was cleaner to lump the two together into a
single sg-match-studententry function.
<p>When called this function is passed a student entry struct.&nbsp; Before
the struct is passed to this function it must have its id and proposition
set.&nbsp; Additionally if the entry is an equation it must be passed to
the Algebra system for parsing.&nbsp; This is the responsibility of Lynnwood
Taylor's code.&nbsp; If the necessary prerequisites have been done then
the system will go ahead and obtain the interpretation(s) of the entry.&nbsp;
Once these have been obtained the system will then mark each interpretation
with its state and place them into the SystemEntry Possible-Cinterps field.
<h4>
Finding the Interpretation(s)</h4>
Non Equation entries are matched using a simple proposition lookup.&nbsp;
When the student makes an entry such as drawing a pair of axes or a vector
then the studententry will contain a proposition form for that action such
as '(draw-axes x 0 y 90).&nbsp; The solutiongraph then searches for a matching
systementry for the specified entry.&nbsp; If one is found then it will
return an interpretation consisting of that entry plus its state.&nbsp;
If none is found then a nil interpretation is returned signalling an error.
<p>Equations by contrast cannot be directly compared to systementries.&nbsp;
Therefore when an equation is entered it must be decomposed into the component
equations.&nbsp; This is handles by the algebra module.&nbsp; For each
of the solution sets that have been stored the algebra system provides
the set of base equations that can be used to build the student equation.&nbsp;
If the equation is completely independent of the set then it will return
nil.&nbsp; Each of these base equations will be matched with their corresponding
systementries.&nbsp; The resulting sets will be returned as the interpretations
with their states set.
<h3>

<h3>
Checking the State:</h3>
In checking the state of an interpretation there are several distinct possibilities
that must be accounted for.&nbsp; Some of the states such as 'Dead-Path'
or 'Forbidden' are handled by the systementry states.&nbsp; Issues such
as the substitution of numbers and prerequisites are handled here.&nbsp;
An interpretation's state is first checked using the systementries->state
function located in the SystemEntry.cl file.&nbsp; If the result is anything
other than correct that will be the state of the interpretation.&nbsp;
If the state is correct then the system will test for prematurity if the
**Test-For-Prematurity** flag is set to t.&nbsp; Similarly if the **Test-For-Premature-Subst**
flag is set to t then the system will test for premature substitution in
equations.
<h4>
<a NAME="Checking prerequisites"></a>Prematurity.</h4>
Before any given systementry can be entered there is typically one or more
entries (such as variable definitions) that must be made.&nbsp; These are
defined as the set of systementries that preceed the entry within a psm
graph.&nbsp; Because a given entry may appear in several graphs there are
several alternate sets of prerequisites for each systementry.&nbsp; In
order for an entry to be premature it all of these entries must contain
at least one uncompleted step.&nbsp; This is a charitable interpretation
of prematurity but it is the one that works best in the system.&nbsp; Thus
we can maintain a single systementry for each unique draw body but not
require that they complete all paths for a problem.
<h4>
<a NAME="Premature numbers"></a>Checking whether the entry has numbers
substituted into it prematurely</h4>
Returns true if the given student entry's interpretation represents an
equation that has given numbers subsituted into it and yet this equation
is not yet the final answer to the problem.&nbsp; To do so, the SG module
checks whether any of the system entries in the interpretation are givens,
and if so, whether there are any non-given system entries that are required
for a complete solution to the problem and have not yet been entered.
<h3>
</h3>

<h3>
<a NAME="Entering"></a>Entering a new entry</h3>
(called from the Entry Interpreter).&nbsp; Given a student entry, this
modifies its the system entries in its interpretation to indicate that
a correct entry has been made.&nbsp; That is, for each system entry in
the interpretation, it pushes this student entry onto the Entered-by field.&nbsp;
It also tells each of the sources of that system entry to up-date their
entered-by fields.
<p>Additionally the assumptions made by the entry are added to the list
of currently active assumptions.&nbsp; This list is then used to filter
out solution sets for equation interpretation.&nbsp; At one time it was
thought that this would be unnecessary.&nbsp; However recent discussions
<a href="DesignDiscussion/ShouldAxesFilterInterpretations.html">here</a>
and <a href="DesignDiscussion/NoNoGoods.html">here</a> have reintroduced
this system.
<h3>
<a NAME="Deleting"></a>Deleting an entry</h3>
(called from the Deletion module).&nbsp; Given a student entry, removes
that entry from the entered-by fields of the system entries in the Interpretation
field of the student entry's interpretation.
<h3>
<a NAME="Load solution graph"></a>Load solution graph</h3>
(called from the manager.). Reads the SG file, which contains solution
graph and the list of solutions sets.&nbsp; It sends the solution sets
to the Algebra Module.&nbsp; It re-creates the Entry index, from the solution
graph so that the sources (cognitive steps) of the system entries of this
list are EQ to the cognitive steps s in the solution graph.&nbsp; While
loading, it should trim the third argument from EQN entry propositions,
as described <a href="EntryPropositions.html#equations">here</a>.
