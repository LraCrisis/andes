Manager</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/30/01)</center>

<p>Author: Linwood Taylor
<p>The&nbsp; manager is the central controller for the Help system.&nbsp;
Its function is to centralize all input and output to and from the tcp/ip
stream with the workbench.&nbsp; Typically the commands from the workbench
will simply be passed to the appropriate modules, and the module's response
will be sent back to the workbench via the tcp/ip connection.&nbsp; More
specifically:
<ul>
<li>
Open Student:&nbsp; Calls <a href="Mastery.html#Open">The Mastery module
to open</a> the student model</li>

<li>
Close a student.&nbsp; Calls <a href="Mastery.html#Close">Mastery module
to close
</a>the student model.</li>

<li>
Open a problem.&nbsp; Calls the <a href="SolutionGraph.html#Load solution graph">SG
module to load the solution graph</a>.</li>

<li>
Close a problem.&nbsp; Calls <a href="Mastery.html#Save">Mastery to save
the student model</a> then calls <a href="Mastery.html#Mastery bar chart">Mastery
to find out the student's levels of mastery</a> and <a href="Mastery.html#Recommend problem">what
problems it recommends</a>.&nbsp; Tells the workbench to present this information
to the student.</li>

<li>
Entry of an equation, vector, variable, axis, angle, etc.&nbsp; Sends the
entry to <a href="EntryInterpreter.html">Entry Interpreter</a>, and gets
back a <a href="Base.html#Tutor turn">tutor-turn</a> struct, which is processed
as described below. .</li>

<li>
Student turn in a dialog.&nbsp; Calls the function in the saved tutor-turn
struct, and gets back a new tutor-turn struct.</li>

<li>
Deletion of an entry.&nbsp; Sends to <a href="DeleteObject.html">Deletion</a>.</li>

<li>
What's next help request.&nbsp; Sends to <a href="NextStepHelp.html">Next
step help</a>, and gets back a tutor-turn struct.</li>

<li>
What's wrong help request.&nbsp; Sends to <a href="WhatsWrongHelp.html">What's
wrong help</a>, and gets back a tutor-turn struct.</li>

<li>
Use of the solve tool.&nbsp; Sends to <a href="SolveTool.html">Solve Tool</a>,
and gets back something to be passed to the workbench.</li>
</ul>
Maintance:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Current Problem name.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Current Student id.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Most recent tutor turn struct
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Whether workbench is in dialog mode or problem
solving mode.
<p>The manager does not (currently) need to do anything at all about saving/restoring
state for the sake of resuming problems or recovering from crashes (see
<a href="DesignDiscussions/ReplayingLogFiles.html">discussion</a>).
<h3>
Processing a <a href="Base.html#Tutor turn">tutor turn</a> received from
a subordinate module:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
If the tutor turn struct has type end-dialog, then the manager tells the
workbench to go to problem solving mode.&nbsp; Also, it sets its mode variable
to problem-solving-mode.</li>

<li>
If the tutor turn struct has type Play-minilesson, then the manager gets
the file name of the minilesson from the text field and tells the workbench
to play that files as a minilesson.&nbsp;&nbsp; The workbench automatically
goes to dialog mode when it is done and prints the message "What would
me to do next?" followed by the Explain-more vs. Hide menu choices.</li>

<li>
If the tutor turn struct has type Dialog, then the manager puts the workbench
in dialog mode if it is not in dialog mode already.&nbsp; It then sends
the text field of the tutor tutor struct to the workbench, along with the
name of the menu to be displayed.</li>
</ul>
In all cases, the manager saves the tutor turn struct, because it is used
to process the student's turn in the dialog if the student mades one.
