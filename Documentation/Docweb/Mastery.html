<h2>
The Mastery module</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/30/01)</center>

<p>This module keeps track of which <a href="#competency">competencies</a>
the student has mastered, where a competency is something like "can solve
statics problems" or "can solve translational kinematics problems".&nbsp;
This assessment of <a href="#Masteries">mastery</a> will not be reliable
enough to be used for high-stakes decision making (e.g., course grades),
because we never really know who is clustered around the keyboard operating
Andes.&nbsp; Thus, we use the assessment only for low-stakes decision making.&nbsp;
In particular, we use it for these purposes:
<ul>
<li>
Advising the student on what problem to solve next.&nbsp; When the student
closes a problem, the Manager calls Mastery to get suggestions for what
problems to try next.</li>

<li>
Advising the student on whether they have mastered the current competency.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the student closes a problem, the Manager reports a histogram of levels
of mastery on each of the competencies.&nbsp; This allows students to decide
whether to do more problems.</li>

<li>
Adapting the dialog.&nbsp; The modules that formulate tutor dialog turns
may sometimes asks the mastery module whether the student has mastered
a particular operator or competency.&nbsp; This can affect whether it generates
a brief explanation or a longer one.</li>
</ul>
In order to preserve information on a student between sessions, the Mastery
module must save a file called the <b>student model</b>.&nbsp; It contains
a profile of mastery (one number per operator) and a list of the problems
the student has attempted, whether they were solved, and with how much
help.
<h3>
<a NAME="competency"></a>Competencies</h3>
A competency is a topic that the domain authors would like students to
master.&nbsp; A competency is defined by a set of operators, and a function
that computes the mastery of the competency given the masteries of the
operators in the set.&nbsp; An operator can be assigned to zero or one
competency, but it can't be assigned to multiple competencies.
<p>Competencies are related by pre-requisite relationships.&nbsp; If A
is a pre-requisite of B, then problems that require B should not be assigned
to students until A has been mastered.&nbsp; Moreover, when Andes shows
a histogram of mastery, if A has not been mastered, then the mastery of
B is not displayed.
<h3>
<a NAME="Masteries"></a>Masteries</h3>
In order to predict grades and other measures of success, it is convenient
to have, for each competence, an estimate of the probability that the student
will correctly answer a problem that involves just that competence.&nbsp;
That is, we assume that there is some underlying, true level of mastery
such that if we gave the student an infinite number of problems that used
just that competence (and the student's learning/memory was turned off),
then the student would answer P of them correctly, where P is a proportion.&nbsp;
One component of mastery is an estimate of P, which we call the estimated
probability of success.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a problem requires several competencies,
then we can estimate the probability of solving the whole problem correctly
by simply assuming conditional independence and taking the product of the
estimated probabilities of success of each of the competencies required
by the problem.
<p>Mastery is an estimate based on a finite sample of the student's behavior.&nbsp;
The best estimate for the real probability of succees, P, is simply S/N,
where S is the number of problems solved succesfully and N is the size
of the sample, i.e., the number of problems total that the student tried
to solve.
<p>Because mastery is an estimate, we need to keep track of how tight an
estimate it is.&nbsp; For that, we use the standard error of the proportion
statistic (Spiegel, pg. 144).&nbsp; That is, if the student has had S success
in N attempts, then the standard error is sqrt([S(N-S)]/N^3).&nbsp; This
only holds for N>30.&nbsp; I am still trying to find the formula for standard
error of the estimated probability when N&lt;30.&nbsp; When Andes displays
a histogram competencies, the estimated probability of success is displayed
by as a point with "whiskers" representing the standard error.
<p>At any rate, for the data structure that represents mastery, it should
suffice to have just two fields: f the number of successes (S) and the
number of attempts (N).&nbsp;&nbsp; The estimates can be compute from them.

its mastery.
<h3>
<a NAME="Recommend problem"></a>Recommend problems</h3>
Given a unit, recommends a problem from that unit. Returns ordered list
of&nbsp; problem file names.
<h3>
<a NAME="Get mastery of operator"></a>Get operator mastery</h3>
Given an operator name, gets the mastery for that operator.
<h3>
<a NAME="Open"></a>Open student model</h3>
Opens the student model file and reads it in.
<h3>
<a NAME="Save"></a>Save student model</h3>
Dumps the current student model to the file in case the system doesn't
close normally.
<h3>
