<h1>Overview of the use of equation independence checking
</h1>
<p>
The help system asks the algebra system if a new equation is independent
of a set of other equations. If it is not independent, it asks what subset
of equations the tested equation depends upon. It asks this question in
two contexts,

The <A HREF="../SolutionGraphGenerator.html">Solution Graph Generator</a> (SGG)
has the responsibility for reading a problem description and generating all
solution paths which a student might use to solve a problem. It 
goes about this by first generating all relevant equations by starting with
the sought quantities, and for each sought quantity, 
using the information in the
problem description and the physics knowledge database to find all equations
involving the variable. Each equation will usually involve other quantities
as well, and these variables become additional soughts if they are not 
already on the list. When all possible equations have been added for all 
quantities sought, this has generated a "skeleton graph" 
(also called a "constraint network", Kenneth D. Forbus and Johan de Kleer,
"Building Problem Solvers", ch. 15). The skeleton graph
consists of equation nodes and variable nodes, with each variable node 
connected to the node for each equation in which that variable occurs.
<P>
Once the skeleton graph is known, the SGG generates all solution paths
which proceed by starting with a sought variable. Each solution path
is a history of expanding bubbles. At each point in the solution the 
sought variables are on the boundary of the bubble, and there may be 
"solved for" variables and used-up equations inside the bubble. The bubble
starts with just the sought quantities. At each stage an equation not currently
in the bubble, but connected to a sought, is considered for inclusion in the
bubble. If it is independent of the equations already in the bubble, it
may be used to "solve for" the sought variable, although the solution may
be in terms of other variables. The variable and the equation are then
tentatively 
moved inside the bubble. The variables occurring in the equation may be
inside or outside the bubble before the inclusion of the equation. 
The variables inside the bubble are considered
already known, so nothing needs to be done with them, 
but any other variables in the equation must be added to the
list of soughts.
<P>
If the new equation is not independent of the equations already inside the
bubble, it is providing no additional information, and we would not be able
to use it to solve for the sought. Thus it is crucial in bubble-growing to
know whether the selected equation is independent of the ones already inside
the bubble. Determining this is the first task of the independence checking 
capacity of the algebra package.

<A NAME=HELPindy>
<H4> Diagnosing which canonical equations the student has used</H4>
<p>
The help system tries to maintain a model of what the student knows about
the solution to the problem being worked on.
When a student enters a correct equation, the help system needs to add to
its estimate of the student's knowledge, primarily by judging that she is
aware of some subset of the canonical equations for the problem. Often the
student's equation is not directly translatable into a single canonical 
equation, but depends on some set of them. From a set of independent canonical
equations, one can ask which ones a given student equation depends upon.
Because in general the canonical equations are not all independent, there
may be different complete sets of independent equations, usually corresponding
to a choice of approach. The help system
can ask for each set which equations are needed to derive the student equation,
and if one answer is much simpler than the others, conclude that the student
is using the approach corresponding to that set.
