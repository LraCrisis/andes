<h1>Checking independence of equations, implementation
</h1>

The independence checker is supposed to keep information about a set
of independent equations (say <i>f<sub>i</sub>(v<sub>j</sub>) = 0</i>),
and answer whether a new equation <i>g(v<sub>j</sub>) = 0</i>
is independent of the ones in the set. If g is not independent in the
linear approximation, 
one can ask for an expansion of g in terms of the f<sub>i</sub>.
If g is linearly independent, it can be added to the set. 
The relevant functions are 
<UL><LI><tt>int 
<A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyStudHowIndy>indyStudHowIndy</A>
(setID,eqnID,deplist,maybelist)</tt>:
           How clearly is the student's equation in 
           slot <tt>eqnID</tt> independent of the equations already 
	   entered in set <tt>setID</tt>. Gives the equations it
	   depends on if it does.
    <LI><tt>int <A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyCanonHowIndy>
indyCanonHowIndy</A>(setID,eqnID,deplist,maybelist)</tt>: 
           As for indyStudHowIndy, except with canonical equation 
	   <tt>eqnID</tt> rather than with a student's equation
    <LI><tt>
<A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyAddEq2CanSet>indyAddEq2CanSet</A>
(setID,eqnID)</tt>: Checks that the canonical
           equation with index <tt>eqnID</tt> is independent of the equations
	   already entered in set <tt>setID</tt>, and if so, adds the equation
	   to the set. If it is not independent, an exception is thrown.
</UL>
The system mantains lists of the student equations and the canonical
equations and variables, with functions which are described

<H3> The Linear Approximation</H3>
Prior to 4/20/01, independence determination was done entirely by looking 
at the linear expansion
of the functions about the solution point. This means that we only looked
at the gradients of the
<i>f<sub>i</sub></i>
and <i>g</i>, and asked
if the last is a linear superposition of the others. The functions 
<i>f<sub>i</sub></i> are entered, one at a time, either as an expression
or as a <tt>valander</tt> (a composite of the value and the gradient at the
solution point). The new gradient is checked for independence of those
already there by <tt>isindy</tt>.
If it is independent, it can be entered into the set by an
immediate subsequent call to <tt>placelast</tt>. 
If it is not, the coefficients of its expansion in terms of the gradients
of the equations entered into the set can be obtained by an immediate
subsequent call to <tt>expandlast</tt>.
<P> Here is where to find the messy <A href=indydet1.html>implementation
details</A>.

<A NAME=BeyondLin><H3> Doing better than the Linear Approximation </H3></a>
Unfortunately it is possible for the linear expansions of a set of 
equations about a solution point to be dependent even when the full equations
are not. For example, W_y = mg sin(theta) is independent of W_y = -mg, 
depending also on the equation theta=270 deg. But expanding to terms linear
in (theta-270) cannot destinguish these two equations, as to this approximation
sin theta is -1. For this reason we have now replaced
<tt><A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyIsStudIndy>
indyIsStudIndy</A>(setID,eqnID)</tt>,
 <tt><A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyIsCanonIndy>
indyIsCanonIndy</A>(setID,eqnID)</tt>,
<tt><A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyExpSetCanEq>
indyExpSetCanEq</A>(setID,eqnID)</tt>, and
    <tt><A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyExpSetStudEq>
indyExpSetStudEq</A>(setID,eqnID)</tt>, which operate only on the 
linear expansions of the relevant equations, with 
<tt>int <A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyStudHowIndy>
indyStudHowIndy</A>(setID,eqnID,deplist,maybelist)</tt> and 
    <tt>int <A HREF=algebra/functdesc.html#indyCanonHowIndy>
indyCanonHowIndy</A>(setID,eqnID,deplist,maybelist)</tt>, 
which make some effort to explore dependence on variables beyond the linear
approximation. In particular, in the process of finding the gradient of
each equation, it marks whether there is any dependence on each variable.
If there is a proposed dependency among equations all of which have zero
partial derivatives in a given variable, but some of which are known to
be dependent on that variable, then we report that their might be another
equation, with nonzero derivative in that variable at the solution point.
If only one of the equations in the proposed dependency has a dependence on
that variable, we are sure the proposed dependency is wrong. If there is 
an assignment statement for that variable, it is added to the definite
dependency list <tt>deplist</tt> or the possible additions <tt>maybelist</tt>.
The return values from indy*HowIndy are
<UL><LI>0: definitely independent
    <LI>1: linear approximation shows dependence on equations linexpand
           but there are indications that that dependence might not
	   extend to independence of the full equation. equations in
	   mightdepend may also be used, as well as others
    <LI>2: linear approximation shows dependence on equations linexpand
	   but there are indications that that dependence might not
	   extend to independence of the full equation, but probably
	   only on the equations in mightdepend	
    <LI>3: appears to be dependent only on equations in linexpand
    <LI>4: definitely dependent only on equations in linexpand
