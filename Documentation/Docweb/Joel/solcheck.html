<p>
If the solver has worked correctly and has found numerical values for
all the variables, all the equations should become tautologies. But
checking would be a good idea. So a program called <tt>solcheck</tt> was
written to read the same file used
by the solver, together with the file the solver output with the solutions,
and check each equation. This functionality has since been incorporated
into the solver itself, so it is no longer necessary to use solcheck, and
it is not being maintained. But the method described below is still the
one being used.
<P>
This evaluation is very straightforward, except for the problem that we
are using real variables with finite precision. In fact, all our calculations
are done in double precision. But what constitutes agreement between the
two sides of an equation?  If the right hand side is zero and the left
is 10<sup>-15</sup>, is this agreement?  Not if the left hand side
involves elementary particle masses in kilograms! The function checksol
attempts to evaluate both the expressions and the possible uncertainty in
the calculation of that expression, and complains only if the observed
error is 100 the calculated expected error.
<P>
This may seem very lax, but considering that the expected relative error in
double precision arithmetic is about 10<sup>-15</sup>, it tends to complain
too much, not too little. But the algorithm is not solidly thought out.
