<h2>Overview of the algebra module</h2>
<h3>Joel Shapiro</h3>

<p>
The algebra package is responsible for handling questions which involve
algebraic manipulation for the Andes system. At various times, it receives
information from the rest of the system. This includes
<ul>
<li> The list of canonical variables (those used in the problem generation)
together with attributes of these variables
<ul><li> nonzero - variable can never be zero (e. g. mass of massive object)
	</li>
    <li> nonnegative - variable is intrinsically non-negative 
    (e. g. magnitude of a vector) </li>
    <li> parameter - variable's value cannot be determined from the information
    given, but is not needed for the solution, or the solution may be expressed
    in terms of this variable.</li>
</ul>
Here are <A HREF="varspec.html">details of the variable specification API .</a>
</li>
<li> The list of equations needed to solve the problem. These may be redundant,
    and the list includes equations which specify numerical values for
    variables whose values are given in the problem statement.
Here are <A HREF="eqnspec.html">details of the equation specification API .</a>
</li>
<li> The equations entered by a student while she is solving the problem. 
These are first translated by the help system into
the canonical variables before presentation to the algebra package.</li>
</ul>

At various times, the algebra system is called upon to perform different 
functions for the help system. The various items described here were originally
addressed by separate programs, but we have now combined them into one.
<ul><li> At problem generation time, the first use of the algebra system
is to <A HREF="solver.html">solve the canonical equations</a>. 
The help system first sends the
algebra system the declaration of variables and the list of equations, 
and when this is complete, the algebra system returns the solution, that is,
a list of values for each variable. Parameters are assigned random positive
values, because color-by-number equation checking and equation independence
requires explicit numerical solutions for all the variables.</li>
<li> The solver procedure does not check its solution, but after the
solution has been generated, there is a 
<A HREF=solcheck.html>solution-checker</A>
which does plug the numerical solution into each of the canonical equations
and report if there are descrepancies. This used to be a separate program,
<tt>solcheck</tt>, but as this has now been built into the solver, the
solcheck program is no longer being maintained.</li>
<li> The bubble graph algorithm for finding solution paths requires
walks through the skeleton of equations and variables. For each variable
sought for inclusion into the bubble, it needs to add an equation which is
independent of those equations inside the bubble. The algebra system can
be told to maintain sets of independent equations (those within some bubble)
and asked for each candidate equation whether it is independent of those in
a given set. If so, it can be added. If not, the subset of equations within the
set from which it can be derived is available from the algebra system.
This task is performed by the <A HREF=indy.html>independence-checker</A>.
</li>
<LI> During student use of Andes, the help system asks the algebra system 
to review the correctness of student equations, and to judge whether and
how those equations might be derived from various subsets of the canonical 
equations, in an attempt to understand which parts of the problem the 
student has already understood and used. This is also done by the 
<A HREF=indy.html>independence-checker</A>.</LI>
</UL>
The use by the help system of the algebra system has evolved over time,
and could change in the future. In particular, there are other ways
independence checking might be used for student modelling, but these are
not currently under development.
<P>
Originally the solver and the checker were independent programs interacting
with files for input and output. A third program, designed to be interactive
with the help system, was added for independence checking at solution graph
generating time. It was then decided that these three tasks, together with
incorporating interaction with the help system, should be incorporated into
a single program. The useful programs that are left are
<UL><LI><a HREF =algebra/colander.html><tt>colander</tt></a>, 
which solves and checks the
problem, taking input from a file, and writing out the solution to a file.
<LI><a HREF =algebra/allprog.html#Solver><tt>Solver.dll</tt></A>, 
which is loaded as
functions by the Andes program, and is called interactively by the help system.
The interactive functions that the help system calls are described in this
link. 
The communication from the help system to the algebra system is currently
being logged in 
a log file, <tt>Solver.log</tt>, but this could be turned off by undefining
<TT><SMALL>SOLVER_IS_DEBUGGING</SMALL></TT>.
<LI><a HREF =algebra/allprog.html#allprog><tt>allprog</tt></A>, 
which is designed to do
off-line testing of the code. It is used primarily after a problem has 
been discovered interactively and the <tt>Solver.log</tt> file saved for
the problem situation. The <tt>allprog</tt> program is recompiled with this
Solver.log, and then run with various 
<A HREF="algebra/offlineDiag.html">diagnostic flags</a> enabled.
<P>
