Physical quantities with units need to have their units specified whenever
they are given a numerical value. In equations, this is done with a DNUM,
in the form 
<center>
<TT>(= <I>varname</I> (DNUM <I>number unitstring</I>)</TT>
</center>
where <I>varname</I> is <A HREF=varspec.html>the name of the variable</A>, 
<I>number</I> is a <A HREF=eqnspec.html#number>numerical value</A>, and
<I>unitstring</I> describes the units as <A HREF=#unitstr>specified below</A>. 
<P>
When a variable is declared, its units are given in the form of a string
of "preferred units", which may be standard SI units or other known units,
in the form
<center>
<TT>(SVAR <I>varname</I> <I>unitstring</I>)</TT>
</center>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=unitstr>The Unit String</A></H3>

The <I>unitstring</I> is composed of units, possibly multiplied together
with . (preferred) or * (non-standard), divided with /, and raised to
explicit numerical value with ^ num. No parentheses are allowed.
The units consist of a base unit and possibly a modifiying prefix. 
The base units are given in the file <TT>units.h</tt>, and include
all SI units,
<TT>m, kg, s, C, K, g, N, J, V, A, T, Wb, ohm, Hz, Pa, F, H, W</TT>,
 and a number of nonstandard ones, including
<tt> deg, rad, rev, lb, day, hr </TT> or <TT>h, min, yr, liter, ft, in, mi, eV,
dyne, erg, cal</TT>. Note that none include a period, as we cannot destinguish
one from the center-dot which is the standard symbol for multiplying units.
<br> The prefixes
are most of the SI ones, including <TT>a, f, p, n, mu</TT> (or <TT>$m</TT>),
<TT> m, c, d, k</TT> (or <TT>K</TT>), <TT>M, G, T, P</TT>, and <TT>E</TT>.
<p>
More information about how the preferred units interact with the standard
units is in <A HREF=varspec.html>the variable specification</A>.
