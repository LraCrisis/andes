<h1 align=CENTER>Combined Algebra Package
</h1>

<A NAME=Solver></a>
The interactive algebra module, Solver.dll, is controlled by calls from
the help system. The main tasks it can perform are
<UL><LI>
     <A HREF=#solvprob>Solving the problem</A> - that is,
     finding the value for all of the
     variables which satisfy all of the equations and constraints.
     <LI>Helping the SGG system in bubble-growing by informing it whether
	  suggested equations to add to the bubble provide new information
	  about the unknowns (are independent of the equations in the bubble)
	  or not. This calls for <A HREF=#indyhelp>independence checking</a>
	  of the canonical equations.
     <LI>Providing the help system with information about the
	  <A HREF=#redgreen>correctness of equations</A> the students enter,
	  and on which canonical equations they might have used to derive
	  the one they stated. This can be investigated by <A HREF=#indystud>
	  asking about dependence</a>
	  of the student's equation on the canonical
	  ones. The algebra package also performs
	  algebraic tasks connected with testing alternatives to the student
	  equation and providing <A HREF=#solvetool>several solve-tools</A>.
</UL>
The first two steps can take place, once for each problem, before they
  are ever presented to the students. The last item is performed
  as part of the tutoring session.
  It cannot be done, however, without the information achieved in the
  first two parts.
<P>
<A NAME=solvprob><H3>Solving the problem</H3></A>
When the help system wants to solve a problem it is developing for the
first time, it asks the algebra system to solve the problem - that is,
find the values of the variables which satisfy all the equations and
constraints. To do this, it must
<UL><LI>  1: Clear the algebra system with solveClear.
     <LI> 2: Send definitions of the variables, their attributes, and the
	  canonical equations for the problem. This is done with
	  <a HREF=functdesc.html#solveAdd>solveAdd</A>.
     <LI> 3: Call <a HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyDoneAddVariable>
     c_indyDoneAddVariable</A> to tell the system you have declared
	  all the variables.
     <LI> 4: initiate the solution of the problem with a call to
      <A HREF=functdesc.html#solveBubble>solveBubble</A>, 
          which returns the first line of the solution.
     <LI> 5: pick up the rest of the lines of the problem one at a time
	  with calls to 
	  <A HREF=functdesc.html#solveMoreBubble>solveMoreBubble</A>, 
	  until a NIL is returned, indicating
	  the solution has been transmitted.
	  <P>
	  If the solution was completely successful, there will be no
	  lines returned in angle brackets. If there were unused variables,
	  variables which could not be solved for, equations which could
	  not be used to solve for variables, or descrepancies in the
	  equations at the solution point, these will follow messages
	  as described in <A HREF=functdesc.html#solveeqs>solveeqs</a>.
	  <P>
	  If it is desired to do more with this problem (such as growing
	  the bubbles or using the problem to tutor), the problem must
	  first be cleaned up of extraneous variables and equations, so
	  that redoing the above proceedure produces a completely successful
	  solution. The lines returned by the algebra system will need to
	  be sent back to it for independence checking. These will be
	  called "the solution" below.
  </UL>
There is an alternate method of solving the problem, using files. The 
information that the help system sends in step 1 above can also be sent
to a file, such as those in T:\VanLehn\Andes2\Equation Files, with 
name <i>probname</i><tt>.eqf</tt>. Then the process of steps 1-5 can
be done by a call to 
<A HREF=functdesc.html#solveBubbleFile>solveBubbleFile</A>. 
In this case, the results are
stored in a file <i>probname</i><tt>.jsol</tt>. 

<A NAME=indyhelp><H3>Independence checking for SGG</H3></A>
   If the help wishes to proceed with generating solution paths by
   growing bubbles on the constraint diagram, it needs independence information
   from the algebra package. Even though the package may just have solved
   the package, it needs to have all memory erased and the information
   fed back to it in a slightly different form. The steps are:
   <UL><LI> 1: clear with a call to 
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#indyEmpty>indyEmpty()</A>.
   <LI> 2: Declare variables and give their <b>values</b> with 
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyAddVariable>c_indyAddVariable</A>, 
   and again give their attributes with 
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#solveAdd>solveAdd</A>.
   <LI> 3: Declare that all variables have been declared with a call to 
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyDoneAddVariable>c_indyDoneAddVariable</A>
   <LI> 4: Present the equations with index numbers, starting with 0
   in order without skipping, with <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyAddEquation>
   c_indyAddEquation</A>. These canonical
   equations will subsequently be referenced by their index number.
   <LI> 5: Sets of independent equations may now be set up by
   calls to <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyAddEq2Set>c_indyAddEq2Set</A>, 
   giving the equation to be added and the
   number of the set to add it to. Sets can only be referred to if they
   already exist or if there number is the next unused one. Equations
   will only be added if their linearizations about the solution point
   are independent of those already in the set. In bubble growing, the
   equations already in the bubble are in the set.
   <LI> 6: New equations being considered for inclusion into the set 
   should be first tested with <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyCanonHowIndy>
   c_indyCanonHowIndy</A>. If it is independent, the equation can be added
   to the bubble and to the set with 
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyAddEq2Set>c_indyAddEq2Set</A>.
   <LI> 7: Sets can be cleared with 
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyKeepNOfSet>c_indyKeepNOfSet</A>(setID,0),
   or it can be cleared of all but the first n entries with
   c_indyKeepNOfSet</A>(setID,n). This latter feature was designed for
   backtracking but is apparently not being used.
</UL>
<A NAME=redgreen><H3>Equation checking</H3></A>
   The system can be used by the help system for validating student equations
   and modelling their knowledge. The system is ready to do so after step
   4 of the last section. The call to ask if an equation is correct is
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyIsStudentEquationOkay>
   c_indyIsStudentEquationOkay</A>. This question can also be asked together
   with a request to add the equation to a sutdent equation slot with the
   command
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyStudentAddEquationOkay>
   c_indyStudentAddEquationOkay</A>.
 Note that if the <tt>Is</tt> command 
   is used
   and the workbench then enters the equation as correct in the student
   slot, it should be added to the algebra systems tables with the <tt>Add</tt>
   form of the command. Conversely, if the <tt>Add</tt> form was used and
   the help system decides to mark the equation non-green, the equation should
   be removed from the slot by calling    
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyStudentAddEquationOkay>
   c_indyStudentAddEquationOkay</A> with a zero-length string as the equation,
   which is the way to erase a slot in the algebra database.

<A NAME=indystud><H3>Independence checking for student modelling</H3></A>
   The help system wants to determine, from the student entries, what
   part of the solution process the student understands, and which of 
   possible alternate paths she is taking. An important source of this
   information is the set of correct equations she has entered. Student
   equations are unlikely to be direct translations of canonical ones - more
   commonly, they are based on some subset of the canonical equations, and
   the help system wants to know which subset of the canonical equations
   the student has used, and therefore presumably understands. Or, quite
   often, what are the possible subsets of equations upon which the student
   may have based her equation. This information can be based on asking
   the algebra system whether the student equation is dependent on an
   independent subset of the canonical equations, and if so, which equations
   it depends on. The call to get this information is
   <A HREF=functdesc.html#c_indyStudHowIndy>c_indyStudHowIndy</A>.
   <P>
   Currently the way the help system uses this capability is to define
   separate complete independent subsets of the canonical equations, so that
   any correct equation can be expanded in any one of them, and it chooses
   among the possibilities the set with the simplest expansion of the 
   student equation. There are possibilities for improving this method
   of using the independence capability in the future.
<A NAME=solvetool><H3>Solve Tools</H3></A>
   The workbench provides several tools the student may use to help with
   the algebra of the problem. They are
   <UL><LI><A HREF=functdesc.html#c_powersolve>c_powersolve</A> This tool
   asks which equation to solve for, and then does its best to solve for 
   that variable. This we call the <B>genie</B> tool, because the answer
   appears with no explanation.
   <LI><A HREF=functdesc.html#c_simplifyEqn>c_simplifyEqn</A> This tool, used
   on the equation in a slot specified by the student, first looks at all the
   student equations for numerical assignment statements which can be used to 
   simplify the specified equation, and then simplifies the equation.
   <LI><A HREF=functdesc.html#c_solveOneEqn>c_solveOneEqn</A> This tool asks
   the student to specify an equation and a variable within it for which it can
   be solved. It writes an equation of the form with that variable on the left
   and an expression not containing that variable on the right. [Call that
   form a algebraic assignment statement].
   <LI><A HREF=functdesc.html#c_subInOneEqn>c_subInOneEqn</A> Asks the 
   student to select an algebraic assignment statement and a target equation
   from among her equations. It then substitutes the assignment statement in
   the target equation and simplifies the result.

<H2><A NAME=allprog><tt>allprog</tt></a>, an offline version of the combined 
program.</H2>
There is a version of the algebra system which can be used independently
of the help system. It does not have any convenient methods for entering
commands, and is intended to be used for debugging when a problem has
been found with the interactive version. The interactive system makes a 
log file, called <tt>Solver.log</tt>, of all the commands made to the
algebra package. This file can be included in an independent <tt>main</tt>
program and compiled, and then run with various diagnostic flags, 
resulting in an output file which can be examined to see what went wrong. 
Precise instructions for using this are in 
<A HREF=offlineDiag.html>Using the offline algebra system</A>.
