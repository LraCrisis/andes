<h1>Classes defined in the Andes2 algebra system
</h1>

The classes defined in the system are
<UL><LI><A HREF=dimens.html>dimens</A>The SI physical units
     for a variable or expression.
<LI><A HREF=expr.html>expr
</A>An algebraic expression, possibly an equation. This is a virtual class
     with subclasses
     <UL><LI>primexpr
	  a virtual subclass with numvalexp and physvarptr and fakeexpr as
	  subclasses
     <LI>fakeexpr
	 A subterfuge of use only during parsing
     <LI>numvalexp
	 A numerical value, with physical units, such as 2.5 m/s
     <LI>physvarptr
	 A variable, represented by a pointer to a
	  <A HREF=physvar.html>physvar</A>
     <LI>binopexp
	 A binary operator between expr's. The available operators are
	  divided-by, raised-to-power, equals, and the unimplemented
	  greater-or-equal and greater-than.
     <LI>functexp
	 A known function of a single argument. The available functions
	  are sin, cos, tan, exp, ln, log10, sqrt, abs
     <LI>n_opexp
	 An n-ary operator among expr's. The available operators are
	  plus and mult.
    </UL>
<LI><A HREF=physvar.html>physvar</A>A physical variable. It contains
     information on attributes, units, names, etc.
<LI><A HREF=indyset.html>indyset
</A>A set of independent functions and methods for determining whether
     the linear expansion of a new function is independent of those in
     the set, and if not, giving its expansion.
<LI><A HREF=indyset.html#valander>valander
</A>A combination of the value and gradient of a function at the solution
     point of the problem, and information about whether the function
     depends on each variable.
<LI>answitherr:
     A combination of the numerical value and absolute error in a numerical
     expression.
<LI>unitabrs: 
  A list of abbreviations for units, unit prefixes, and preferred ways
     of expressing combinations of units.
<LI>oper:
  a class with a fixed set of instantiations, one for each function type
     for a functexp or each operator for a binopexp or n_opexp.
     </UL>
