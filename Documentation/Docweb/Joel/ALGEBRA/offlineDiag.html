<h1 align=CENTER>Off line diagnosis of the algebra system.
</h1>

This page describes how to run the off-line version of the algebra
system to help diagnose a problem found with the interactive system.
<P>
It assumes you have access to the full system so as to reproduce the
error and extract the Solver.log file generated. It assumes you have
a unix-clone environment with make and g++, in which you have three
directories all subdirectories of the same parent, named src, gpp, and run.
It assumes you have all the source code in src, and the Makefile in gpp.
Finally, it assumes you have an editor capable of handling and searching
large files.
<P>
The steps in producing a diagnostic output are:
<UL><LI>Find the source directory for the Andes2 executable. This
directory should contain Andes2.exe, Andes2.dxl, fbd-tcp.exe, and a 
subdirectory Solver_Release containing Andes2.dll. If it also contains
a file Solver.log, delete that.
<LI>Run Andes2 on the problem that needs debugging, and reproduce the error.
<LI>Shut down Andes2.
<LI>copy or move the Solver.log file produced in the Andes2 directory to the
src directory.
<LI>cd to the gpp directory and execute make. At least main will be recompiled.
<LI>cd to the run directory and execute <br>
<center><tt>./allprog &nbsp; <i>hexflags</i> &nbsp;&gt; allpr.out </TT>
</center>
The value of hexflags, given in hexadecimal, determines which diagnostics
you want turned on, as described in the file dbg.h and the individual 
source files. Except for the 1's bit, the flag is just the logical or
of the diagnostics you want. The 1's bit produces more details of the
categories turned on by the other bits. If you want everything, use
<center><tt>./allprog &nbsp;  7fffffff &nbsp;&gt; allpr.out</tt></center>
<LI>You better have a good editor to help you search through the allpr.out
file.
</UL>
