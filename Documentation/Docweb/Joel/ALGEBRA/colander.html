<h2>Problem solver for Andes2
</h2>
<h3>Joel Shapiro</h3>
</center>

The beginning of the use of the algebra system in the history of a physics
problem is to solve the &#147;canonical&#148; equations. This can be done
by the stand-alone program <tt>colander</tt>, which gets its input from a
<i>probname</I><TT>.eqf</tt> file, or from the help system
<A HREF=allprog.html#solvprob>with the Solver.dll</a>. The general
procedure in either case is outlined in 
<A HREF=../solver.html>&#147;Canonical Equation Solving&#148;</A>. Here we 
describe the functions involved in <tt>colander</tt>.
<P>
The program is called with possible debug flags, and if debugging is
used it will produce a lot of output, so output should be redirected to
a file. Thus the calls might be
<center><Table WIDTH=70%>
<TR><TD><tt>./colander</tt></TD><TD>if not debugging</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>./colander</tt> <i>hexflags</i> &nbsp; &gt; &nbsp; <i>outfile</i>
</TD><TD>if debugging</TD></TR></TABLE></center>
where <i>hexflags</i> is a hex number giving the  <A HREF=offlineDiag.html>
diagnostic level</A>, also described in <tt>dbg.h</tt>.
<P>
The <tt>main</tt> of the <tt>colander</tt> program is in the file
<tt>colget.cpp</tt>. It sets up the path for finding the input file,
which it currently expects to find in the directory
<tt>C:/joel/math/data/eqs.wur/</tt>. It prompts for the name of the 
problem, <i>probname</i>, which must be given (case-sensitively ?) without 
extension. Colander tacks on <tt>.eqf</tt>, and reads the file from the 
above directory. It will write the solutions in a file in the <b>current</b>
directory, called <i>probname</i><tt>.jsol</tt>.
<P>
Colget initializes the table of unit abbreviations, calls 
<A HREF=functdesc.html#getallfile>getallfile</a>
to read in the input information, sets an ofstream to the output file,
and calls 
<A HREF=functdesc.html#solveeqs>solveeqs</a>
If solveeqs finds no problems, it then calls 
<A HREF=functdesc.html#checksol>checksol</a>
on each equation and reports any discrepancies in the evaluation. Then it calls
<A HREF=functdesc.html#dimchkeqf>dimchkeqf</a>
to check for discrepancies in the units.
<P>
<A HREF=functdesc.html#solveeqs>solveeqs</a>
makes a copy of all the input equations, 
does elementary simplifications and dimensional analysis checking, adds
the assignment statements for parameters, and then calls checkeqs to 
actually solve the system of equations. If checkeqs fails to use up all
equations or solve for all variables, this is then reported in the output file.
<P>
Most of the work is done in 
<A HREF=functdesc.html#checkeqs>checkeqs</a>
The file <tt>checkeqs.cpp</tt> has extensive comments at the beginning 
describing its approach, though much of this described in
<A HREF=../solver.html>Canonical Equation Solving</A>.
