<h1>Expressions in the Algebra System
</h1>

This page discusses the internal representation of expressions in the
algebra system.
<p>
In the Andes2 algebra system, expressions are represented internally
by <TT> class expr</TT>, which is defined in file <TT>expr.h</TT>. This is
an abstract class, from which are inherited subclasses which get
instantiated, in this fashion:
<UL><LI><TT>expr</TT> (an abstract class only)
    <UL><LI><TT>primexpr</TT> (also an abstract class - an expr with no
	 children)
	<UL><LI><TT>fakeexpr</TT> - instantiated only as a placeholder for
	     stack
	    <LI><TT>numvalexp</TT> - a numerical value together with physical
		 units
	    <LI><TT>physvarptr</TT> - a physical variable, or more accurately,
		 a pointer to a <A HREF=physvar.html><TT>physvar</TT></A>.
	</UL><LI><TT>binopexp</TT> - a binary operator with two child
	     expr's<br>
	         These are of the following types:<br>
	         divided-by, to-power, equals, greater-than, greater-or-equal.
	      (The last two are not currently used.)
        <LI><TT>functexp</TT> - a function of one argument, a child expr. <br>
		  The system knows about the following functions:<br>
		  sin, cos, tan, exp, ln, log<sub>10</sub>, sqrt, abs.
	<LI><TT>n_opexp</TT> - a n-ary operator with a variable number of
		  children. There are only two n-ary operators used, plus
		  and multiply.
</UL></UL>
All expr have the member fields
<UL>
  <LI><TT>bool known</TT> - this is not fully implemented - in the early code 
       we tried to treat `known' variables differently than undetermined ones,
       even if we did not have a specific numerical value for them. But this
       was not carried through in the code.
  <LI><TT>exprtype etype</TT> - one of: unknown, numval, physvart, binop, n_op,
       function, or fake.
  <LI><TT>dimens MKS</TT> - the <A HREF=dimens.html>physical units</A>
       of this expression.
</UL>
In addition to these data fields, which the subexpr inherit, the different
subclasses have additional fields:
<UL>
  <LI><TT>int varindex</TT> (physvarptr only). The index of the physical
       variable in the list of `canonical' physical variables
       <TT>canonvars</TT>.
  <LI><TT>double value</TT> (numvalexp only).  The SI units value for this
       physical quantity. In the versions since April 7, 2001, numvals
       representing all angles are given in radians.
  <LI><TT>oper *op</TT> and <TT>oper *f</TT>: (binopexp and n_opexp for op,
       functexp for f).
       An <TT>oper</TT> is a class which tells which kind of
       operator or function we have. The internal enum names are:<br>
       <TT>pluse, multe, divbye, topowe, equalse, grte, gree, sine, cose, tane,
       expe, lne, log10e, sqrte, abse</TT> .<br>
       The <TT>oper</TT> also contains the printable name, such as '^'
       or '<tt>sin</tt>'.
  <LI><TT>expr *arg</TT> (functexp only)<br>
       <TT>expr *lhs, *rhs</TT> (binopexp only)<br>
       <TT>vector<expr *> *args</TT> (n_opexp only) - pointers to the children.
</UL>
Member functions: (Some that shouldn't be used are not listed)
<UL><LI>constructors (and an adjuster)
    <UL><LI> for <TT>expr</TT>
	<UL><LI> <TT>expr()</TT>
            <LI> <TT>expr(exprtype)</TT>
	    <LI> <TT>expr(expr &)</TT></UL>
	<LI> for <TT>numvalexp</TT>
	<UL><LI> <TT>numvalexp(int value)</TT>
	    <LI> <TT>numvalexp(float value)</TT>  [don't use this -
		 values need precision]
	    <LI> <TT>numvalexp(double value)</TT>
	    <LI> <TT>numvalexp(string value)</TT></UL>
	<LI> for <TT>physvarptr</TT>
	<UL><LI> <TT>physvarptr(int k)</TT>  [k is index in canonvars]</UL>
	<LI> for <TT>binopexp</TT>
	<UL><LI> <TT>binopexp(oper *op, expr *lhs, expr *rhs)</TT></UL>
	<LI> for <TT>functexp</TT>
	<UL><LI> <TT>functexp(oper *f, expr *arg)</TT></UL>
	<LI> for <TT>n_opexp</TT>
	<UL><LI> <TT>n_opexp(oper *op)</TT> Makes a sum or product, but
	     without any initial terms or factors.
	    <LI> <TT>void addarg(expr *arg)</TT> Adds a term/factor to an
		 n_op, adjusting the dimensions of the sum/product.
	  </UL>
	    </UL>
    <LI>information extractors (and one inserter)
    <UL><LI> <TT>bool expr::isknown()</TT>  [never used]
	<LI> <TT>bool expr::setknown()</TT>  [never used]
	<LI> <TT>string <A HREF="expr2.html"#GETINFIX>getInfix()</A></TT>
	     returns a fully parenthesized infix
	     form of the expression
	<LI> <TT>void  <A HREF="expr2.html#PRETTY">pretty</A>(int indent)</TT>
	     prints an indented tree-like
	     form of the expression. Not much used - I think it omits units.
	<LI> <TT>void <A HREF="expr2.html"#DBGPRINT>dbgprint</A>(int indent)
	     </TT> prints an indented tree-like
	     form of the expression with markers for the kind of expr, and
	     units given as powers of m, kg, s, C, K for each expr.
        <LI> <TT>string <A HREF="expr2.html"#GETLISP>getLisp</A>(bool)</TT>
	     prints a prefix form of the
	     expression suitable for lisp. If the argument is true, variable
	     names and units are enclosed in vertical bars, which are needed
	     to tell the brain-dead lisp that it should pay attention to case.
        <LI> <TT>string <A HREF="expr2.html"#SOLPRINT>solprint</A>(bool)</TT>
	     (binopexp only) Prints an equation
	     which is an assignment (ie. it is physvar = numval) in the form
	     required for the solution file (for the solution checker and
	     independence checker) if the arg is false, and in the form
	     for the help system if the arg is true.
	<LI> <TT>double getlength()</TT>, <TT>getmassd()</TT>,
	     <TT>gettimed()</TT>, <TT>getcharged()</TT>, and
	     <TT>gettempd()</TT> - returns the exponent
	     to which m, kg, s, C, K are
	     raised in the physical dimensions of this expr.   </UL>
    <LI> destructor
    <UL><LI> <TT>expr::destroy()</TT> - removes all children as well as
	 the expr itself.
	 It is standard procedure to regard all children as belonging to the
	 expression - children should not be shared. But they may be
	 transferred from an expression about to be deleted, not destroy()ed.
	 
</UL>
The functions for class expr are contained in <TT>expr.cpp</TT> and
<TT>exprp.cpp</TT>, the latter containing the printing and string output
functions. There are also functions in <TT>copyexpr.cpp</TT> and
<TT>moreexpr.cpp</TT> which should probably be made member functions.
