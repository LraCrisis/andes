<h1>The <tt>indyset</tt> class </h1>

An indyset maintains a list of independent functions
(representing an equation in the form eqn->lhs = 0)
in the form of their <tt>valander</tt>'s, which consist of their values and
gradients at the solution point, together with flags that describe which
variables they depend upon. It is principally used to determine the
dependence of the linear expansion of functions around the solution point,
which determines the dependence of the equations.
See <A HREF=../indyMathMeth.html>Mathematical method of determining
independence</A>.
<P>
The basis vectors are generated sequentially from the presented	
gradients by projecting out previous equations so as to 	
keep the matrix a column permutation of a row-echelon form matrix.
The permutation required is kept in ordervar (viz.)
<P>
The data in an indyset is:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; basis
</TD><TD>basis vectors for gradients already in
the set of independent equations.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>  int numvars</TD><TD>The number of variables in the problem</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>  int numinset</TD><TD>The number of equations already
in the set</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>  vector&lt;int&gt; ordervar</TD><TD>order of variables to eliminate. 
		basis[i][ordervar[j]] is 0 for i &gt; j</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>  vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; basexpand &nbsp; </TD><TD>
  basis[i] is basexpand[i][j] *grad expr[j], where expr[j] is 
  the j'th expression presented.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>  bool lastisvalid</TD><TD> set when candidate is expanded, to enable
    placelast or expandlast</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>  vector&lt;double&gt; candexpand</TD><TD>expansion of candidate gradient
   in terms of basis (not expr - this is done on request)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>  vector&lt;double&gt; candleft</TD><TD> gradient of candidate minus
stuff from candexpand</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
The functions belonging to the class are described under
<A HREF=functdesc.html#indyf>functions for investigating
independence</A>.

<H3><A NAME=valander>The <tt>valander</tt> class</A></H3>

Class valander contains the value and the gradient of a function	
at the solution point. The new version also includes a vector of bools,
hasvar[k], telling whether the function has any dependence on the variable k .
