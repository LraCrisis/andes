We might bring these up for discussion with the usna folk.

How should implicit equations be displayed. Right now, when a student
draws a vector without crippling the angle, an equation theta_v = number
is generated in a separate window from that in which the student enters
quations. Are these considered part of his equations? <br>
Special treatment for g? <br>(and others, G, e, \epsilon_0 to come)
