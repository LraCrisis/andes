Checking independence of equations

<h3>Joel Shapiro</h3>

<p>
The independence checking has now been incorporated into a composite
program which does everything the algebra system can do.
There is an interface to call the functions as a DLL, but there is also a 
self-contained program <TT>allprog</TT> for testing independent of the
help system.
<P>
The independence checking originally only checked independence of the
linear expansions of the equations about the solution point.
While is was always understood
that this could find spurious dependency if the solution point happened
to be a critical point of the equations, it was not realized how commonly
this arises due to the prevalence of angles which are a multiple of 
Pi/2 at the solution point. Methods for dealing with these common exceptional
situations have now been implemented.
<P>
The basic functionality of the linearized independence checking
is implemented in <tt>isindy</tt>,
<TT>placelast</TT>, and <TT>expandlast</TT>. These are called upon
by functions one level up. The improvements to go beyond linear independence
are in <tt>newindy.cpp</tt>.
