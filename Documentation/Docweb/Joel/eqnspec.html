<h2>Details of the equation specification</h2>
<h3>Joel Shapiro</h3>
</center>

<p>
Equations are input to the algebra system in a Lisp format prefix 
style. Each equation must begin with "(= ". Equations may use the
binary operators / (divide), ^ (raise to power), - (subtraction),
 and the leading =. There is also a unary -.
Adding and multiplying, + and *, are n_ary operators. There are also
functions of a single operator. The known functions are:<br>
<TT>sin</TT>, <TT>cos</TT>, <TT>tan</TT>, <TT>log10</TT>, <TT>ln</TT>, 
<TT>exp</TT>, <TT>sqrt</TT>, <TT>abs</TT><BR>
The trig functions assume their arguments in radians (but see the
<A HREF=dnumspec.html>specification of units</A> for a discussion of
variables expressed in degrees).
<p>
The objects on which the operators and functions act are either 
primitive expressions or parenthesized composite expressions. The
primitive expressions are either "numvalexp"s, which are physical
quantities with given numerical value and given set of units, or
"physvar"s, variables representing physical quantities. 
<p>
Numerical quantities, unless dimensionless, are specified using
a "dnum". For example, the gravitational acceleration near the Earth's
surface might be given by the equation
<center>
(= g_Earth (DNUM 9.8 m/s^2))
</center>
<p>
The specifications are given for numerical values below, and
elsewhere for <A HREF=varspec.html>variables names</A> 
and <A HREF=dnumspec.html>DNUMs</A>.
<p>
Numerical values are expressed in standard C/Fortran form, and may be
either integers or floating point expressions, with possible leading
minus sign, possible exponent in E form, with no spaces or commas. For 
example, the electron charge could be given as
<center>
(= q_electron (DNUM -1.602R-19 C))
</center>
<P>
A Note on accuracy:<br>
The help system requires detailed numerical comparisons to determine
not only the correctness of student input, but also to analyse dependence
of equations. Thus internal calculations are done to high precision - 
16 decimal digits of accuracy, and terms are considered unequal if they
differ by more than one part in 10<sup>11</sup>. For this reason, it
is essential that all numerically given values be consistent to very high
accuracy. For example, in Exdr5A, an object is swinging in a circle 
suspended by string at 20<sup>o</sup>, and the student is told the velocity is 
5.19 m/2. While that should cause the no trouble for the student, the
algebra system regards this as inconsistent with g=9.8 m/s^2, and in the
defprob, the velocity needs to be specified as 5.188957381849970 m/s.
