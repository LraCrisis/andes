<h1>Mathematical method of determining independence
</h1>

The independence checking is done primarily by examining the independence
of the linearized equations which emerge by expanding the equations to first
order in the deviation of the variables from the solution point. For this 
reason, it can be done only after a solution point has been determined.
<p>
Linear equations are independent if the normal vectors to their solution
hyperplanes are independent. The normal vector of the solution plane of the
linearized equation is given by the gradient of f when the equation is
expressed in the form f(v<sub>j</sub>) = 0. So the independence checking
algorithm attemps to expand the gradient of the equation to be tested
in terms of the gradients of the equations in the set.
<p>
To speed up checking of many test equations, the equations entered into the
set are not each represented seperately by their gradient, but by what is
left after this procedure: Each new equation is assigned a variable it is
responsible for. When a new equation (and gradient) is to be added to the set,
its component in each direction already assigned is removed by subtracting
off multiples of the assigned gradient for that variable. The largest
component (in magnitude) in what is left decides the variable assigned to
the new equation, and what is left is entered in place of the full gradient
for this equation. This permits a linear expansion of any proposed new 
gradient by successively subtracting off the assigned variables.
<p>
The details of the method as implemented in <tt>indyset</tt>
<A HREF=indydetail2.pdf>are given here</A>.
<P>
Note that a linear dependence among the linearized equations may, in
exceptional cases, not guarantee the independence of the full equations.
This may arise if the solution point, about which the linear expansion is
taken, is a critical point of one of the equations. If one of the functions
f(v<sub>j</sub>), which is 0 at the solution point, also happens to have
zero derivative at that point, it will appear in linear approximation not
to depend on v<sub>j</sub> at all. To avoid concluding that when it is 
not true of the full function, we have added to the <tt>valander</tt> 
structure information on whether there is any dependence on each variable.
We now have <A HREF=indy2.html#BeyondLin>new methods</A> to deal 
with this situation.
