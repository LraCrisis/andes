<h2>Details of the variable specification</h2>
<h3>Joel Shapiro</h3>
</center>

<p>
Physical variables are given `canonical' names by the SGG system,
which also determines
the physical units in which to express this variable. This information is sent
to the algebra system in a declaration, or SVAR statement. At problem-solving
time, the form of the statement to the algebra system is 
<center>
<TT>(SVAR </TT><i>varname unitstring</i> <TT>)</TT>
</center>
After the problem has been solved, the algebra package returns the solution
for each variable with a statement
<center>
<TT>(SVAR </TT><i>varname number unitstring</i> <TT>)</TT>
</center>
The variable name <i>varname</i> is composed of (case-sensitive) letters,
numbers, _, and $, beginning with a letter or $. It must not have spaces,
-, ., or anything else.
<p>
The number is an integer, floating point expression, or $P, which represents
pi. The floating point expression may have an exponent in usual C/Fortran
form.
<p>
The unitstring is composed of units listed in <tt>units.h</tt>, possibly
coupled with prefix modifiers as described in <TT>prefixes.h</TT>, and
combined with . for multiplication, / for division, and ^<i>number</i>
for powers. No parentheses are allowed.
<P>
When the help system wants the algebra system to help in bubble growing or
for tutoring help, the form it uses to declare the variables is  
<center>
<TT>(indyAddVar </TT><i>varname number unitstring</i><TT>)</TT>
</center>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Variable attributes</H3>
The solver needs to know if there are conditions on the values of the
variables to be solved. The help system specifies these conditions with
these statements:
<UL><LI><tt>(nonnegative</tt> <i>varname</i><tt>)</tt> &nbsp; The variable
     cannot take a negative value
<LI><tt>(positive</tt> <i>varname</i><tt>)</tt> &nbsp; The variable can
     only have values larger than zero
<LI><tt>(nonzero</tt> <i>varname</i><tt>)</tt> &nbsp; The variable cannot
     have a zero value
<LI><tt>(parameter</tt> <i>varname</i><tt>)</tt> &nbsp; The variable's value
     cannot be determined from the equations. The solution to the problem is
     supposed to work for any positive value of the variable, with values
     of other variables possibly expressed algebraically in terms of the
     parameters.
