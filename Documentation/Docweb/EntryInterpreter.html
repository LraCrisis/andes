<h3>
Parsing and interpreting an equation.</h3>
1.&nbsp; Create a <a href="Base.html#Student entry">student entry</a> struct
and put the string typed by the student into its Verbatim slot.&nbsp; Call
the <a href="EquationParser.html">Equation Parser</a>.&nbsp; If the student's
string contains undefined variables, numbers without units or illegal syntax,
then the parser returns an error message.&nbsp; The entry interpreter wraps
this in a <a href="Base.html#Tutor turn">tutor turn</a> that instructs
the workbench to turn the equation red, to print the error message in the
dialog window, and to display the "Hide" menu button.
<p>2.&nbsp; If the parsed equation has legal syntax, then send it to the
<a href="AlgebraManipulation.html#Check student equation">algebra
module</a> for interpretation.&nbsp; The algebra module returns a possibly
null set of interpretations, where each interpretation is set of <a href="Base.html#System entry">system
entry identifiers</a>.&nbsp; The interpretations are stored in the entries
Correct-interpretations field.&nbsp; Because we have decided that buggy
operators will not be necessary (see <a href="DesignDiscussion/AreBuggyOpsNeeded.html">discussion</a>),
a student equation is correct if and only if has at least one interpretation.&nbsp;
If the set of interpretations is null, then set the entry's Correctness
to Incorrect, and return a tutor turn struct that turns the equation red.&nbsp;
Otherwise, go on to the next step.
<p>3.&nbsp; If there are multiple interpretations, then determine the most
probable one as follows.&nbsp; (This is a simple procedure.&nbsp; We need
to test it with log file data by seeing if it selects the same interpretations
as we do.&nbsp; If not, then we can make it more complex.)&nbsp; We compute
the Cognitive Load of an interpretation (which is a positive floating point
number) by summing the cognitive loads of each of the equation system entries
that have not yet been entered.&nbsp; A system entry contains a field for
the operator that generated it, from which we can look up the definition
of the <a href="Base.html#Operator">operator</a>.&nbsp; The operator definition
has a slot for cognitive loads.&nbsp; The interpretation with the lowest
total cognitive load is selected as the most probable interpretation of
the student's entry, with ties broken arbitrarily.&nbsp; At this point,
we have a single interpretation, which is stored in the Interpretation's
slot.&nbsp; We go to interpretation of recognized entries, below.
<h3>
Parsing and interpreting a non-equation entry</h3>
1.&nbsp; First we create a <a href="Base.html#Student entry">student entry
</a>struct
to represent the student's action.&nbsp; This is not as easy as it sounds.
The Workbench's call (see the
<a href="api.html">API spec</a>) specifies
a student entry plus its arguments, but that information has to be translated
into an <a href="Base.html#System entry">Entry Proposition</a>.&nbsp; This
requires a domain-specific translation procedure.&nbsp; If the author changes
the KB in such a way that more entry propositions are created or the syntax
of existing entry propositions changes, then this translation function
must change as well.&nbsp; The list of current entry propositions is <a href="EntryPropositions.html">here</a>.
<p>2.&nbsp; Call the <a href="SolutionGraph.html#Search for match to entry">Solution
Graph</a> module to find a <a href="Base.html#System entry">system entry</a>
that matches this one.&nbsp; If it is not found, then the module returns
NIL so set the entry's Correctness to Incorrect and return a tutor turn
that colors the entry red.&nbsp;&nbsp; If one is found, then we get back
an interpretation consisting of a singleton set that holds a system entry
that correspond to the student's entry.&nbsp; Store this in Correct-interpretations
and store its only member, an interpretation, in Interpretations, and go
on to interpretation of recognized entries, below.
<h3>
Interpretation of recognized entries</h3>
At this point,&nbsp; the student's entry has been recognized.&nbsp; That
is, there is a non-null set of system entries in its Interpretation field.&nbsp;
However, the student's entry could be any of Forbidden, dead-path or two
kinds of premature.
<p>1.&nbsp; If any of the system entries in the interpretation are Forbidden,
set the student entry's Correctness field to Forbidden and return a tutor
turn struct that says, "That is part of a correct solution to the problem,
but it is a solution that you should not use (see the problem statement).&nbsp;
Andes will delete it.&nbsp; Try to find a different way to solve the problem."&nbsp;
The menu has Explain-more and Hide.&nbsp; Explain-more says, "Some physics
problems have two or more solution strategies.&nbsp; For instance, when
a rock falls from a known height starting at rest, one can find its final
velocity either via Conservation of Energy or via a combinations of translational
kinematics and Newton's second law.&nbsp; Sometimes instructors would like
you to use a newly taught method rather than one taught earlier.&nbsp;
If so, they will mark one of the solutions strategies in such a way that
Andes will forbid you from using it.&nbsp; That is what is occuring here.&nbsp;
You have tried to enter something that is a part of a forbidden solution
strategy but is not a part of one of the strategies that the instructors
would like you to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, Andes will delete it.&nbsp; You
should try to solve this problem another way. (Hint: Think about methods
that you were taught recently.)"
<p>2. If any of the system entries in the Interpretation are dead-path,
then set the entry's Correctness to Dead-path and return a tutor turn struct
that says, "Although that is a reasonable way to solve the problem, it
will not lead to a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andes can only recognize successful
derivations, so it is coloring this one 'incorrect'.&nbsp; Try a different
approach.&nbsp; Ask for What's Next help if you would like a hint on finding
one."&nbsp; The menu has Explain-more and OK.&nbsp; The Explain-more button
says, "Sometimes a problem seems solvable with a certain method, but it
is not.&nbsp; For instance, if a problem wants you to calculate the duration
of an object's trip, it might seem that you could use the definition of
speed as distance divided by duration.&nbsp; However, if the problem does
not provide the information required to calculate the objects speed and
the distance that it has travelled, then this method won't work.&nbsp;
Andes only knows about correct, complete solutions to the problems, so
if someone tried to define a speed variable for this problem, Andes would
know that it is not part of a successful solution and would mark it incorrect.&nbsp;
That is what has happened in this case.&nbsp; You have entered a step is
a reasonable approach to solving the problem, but it doesn't happen to
work.&nbsp; Andes only knows about derivations that correctly solve the
problem, and it colors everything else 'incorrect.'&nbsp; Thus, you should
try to find a different approach to solving this problem.&nbsp; Don't be
shy about asking for What's Next help if you want some."&nbsp;&nbsp; For
a discussion of why Andes recognizes dead-paths, see <a href="DesignDiscussion/DeadPaths.html">here</a>.
<p>3.&nbsp; Call the Solution Graph module to check for the student <a href="SolutionGraph.html#Checking prerequisites">skipping
prerequisite steps</a>.&nbsp; The module returns T if there is a prerequisite
violation and NIL otherwise.&nbsp; If there is a prerequisite violation,
then return a tutor turn that says, "Before you can do that, you need to
at least one other step first.&nbsp; I'll leave your entry black so that
you can easily re-enter it when you've finished."&nbsp; The menu contains
"OK" which closes the dialog and turns the entry black, and "Explain more"
which says, "Certain steps in problem solving, such as drawing a coordinate
system or writing and equation first in terms of component variables, are
often skipped by students and this causes them to make careless mistakes
that can be difficult detect and fix.&nbsp; One of the goals of Andes is
to make sure that you know what these critical steps are and when to do
them, and to try to convince you to always do them.&nbsp; Once you have
demonstrated mastery of the steps, Andes will let you skip them if you
want, but it will continue to encourage you not to.&nbsp; In this case,
you have skipped at least one prerequisite step.&nbsp; If you can't immediately
see what the missing prerequisites are, use the light-bulb button to ask
Andes "what should I do next?"&nbsp; After you have done all the prerequisites,
you can reenter this step.&nbsp; Equations can be re-entered by just putting
the cursor in them and pressing the Enter key.&nbsp; Non-equations can
be re-entered by clicking on them with the right mouse button, which causes
a dialog box to appear, then then clicking on the OK button in the dialog
box."&nbsp; This response to the prequisite violation is more easily implemented
than the optimal response (see <a href="DesignDiscussion/EntryPropositionAmbiguity.html#eq entry propositions have eq pre-reqs">discussion</a>
and <a href="DesignDiscussion/ShouldAxesFilterInterpretations.html">discussion</a>).
<p>4.&nbsp; If the entry is an equation, then ask the solution graph module
if the interpretation has <a href="SolutionGraph.html#Premature numbers">premature
substitution of numbers</a>.&nbsp; If so, then return a tutor turn struct
that has the workbench say, "You have not yet reached the end of the solution,
but you have substituted values for some of the variables.&nbsp; This practice
is discouraged because it can lead to errors, and because it makes it harder
to understand the physical interpretation of the equations.&nbsp; Thus,
Andes is going to delete this equation.&nbsp; You should retype it without
the given values."&nbsp; The menu has an Explain Futher button that says,
"For instance, if the problem says that the mass of a block is 5 kg, and
you define mb as the variable for the blocks' mass, then you should always
use mb in your equations and not 5 kg.&nbsp; The exception is in the penultimate
equation of the solution, where you substitute all the given values at
once.&nbsp; You can solve this equation arithmetically to obtain the problem's
answer."&nbsp; When the student OKs either of these messages, Andes should
delete the equation.
<p>5.&nbsp; Otherwise, the entry is acceptable.&nbsp; Return a tutor turn
struct that tells the workbench to color it green, and tell the so<a href="SolutionGraph.html#Entering">lution
graph module to enter the entry</a>&nbsp; and the&nbsp; <a href="EquationParser.html">Equation
Parser</a> to update the symbol table.
