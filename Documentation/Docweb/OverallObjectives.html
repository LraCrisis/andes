Overall Objectives of Andes 2</h2></center>

<center>(as of 4/5//01; new material is underlined)</center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
The first complete version of Andes was evaluated in fall 1999 at the USNA.&nbsp;
In analyses during the early spring of 2000, we discovered that many of
the hints given to students were inadequate.&nbsp; This sparked a redesign
effort that lasted until May 2000.&nbsp; At that point, the Andes team
split into a group that was developing a new version of Andes with better
hints (Andes 2) and a group&nbsp; that was extending the old version of
Andes to cover more problems and more chapters (Andes 1).&nbsp; Andes 1
is being evaluated at the USNA during fall 2000, with the expectation that
the enhanced coverage will cause larger learning gains.&nbsp; When the
evaluation is completed, Andes 1 will be retired.&nbsp; Our goal is to
have Andes 2 ready soon afterwards for pilot evaluations in spring 2001
at the USNA.&nbsp; It must be ready for a full evaluation by fall 2001.&nbsp;
The expectation is that it will have broader coverage than Andes 1 and
better hints, so it should cause much larger learning gains.
<p>More specifically, the primary goals for the fall 2001 are:
<ul>
<li>
Extend coverage</li>

<ul>
<li>
A few chapters of electricity and magnetism</li>

<li>
More qualitative mechanics problems</li>
</ul>

<li>
Improve learning</li>

<ul>
<li>
More procedural constraints</li>

<li>
Better hints &amp; more minilessons</li>

<li>
Fading</li>

<li>
Skillometer and suggesting extra problems</li>
</ul>

<li>
Sustainability</li>

<ul>
<li>
Computational algebra subsystem (CAS)</li>

<li>
Rewrite physics KB in Andes script</li>

<li>
Rewrite help system</li>
</ul>

<li>
Empirical studies</li>

<ul>
<li>
Formative: Snapshot critiques; log file regressions</li>

<li>
Summative: Andes vs. controls (no tutor, human tutors)</li>

<li>
Value added: Andes vs. Andes without X</li>
</ul>
</ul>
These goals are discussed in more detail in the proposal.&nbsp; This document
concentrates the changes to the software necessary for their implementation.
<h2>
Changes between Andes 1 and Andes 2</h2>
This section lists the main changes between Andes 1 and 2 in more detail.
<h3>
Changes to the Workbench</h3>

<p><br>1. New drawing tools may be necessary for electricity and magnetism.&nbsp;
More on this later, when we have selected some problems.
<p>2. Basic idea: Students can do extra problems, suggested by Andes, in
order to raise their projected exam scores.&nbsp; Why: Mastery learning
can raise scores by 1.0 standard deviation, but we can’t mandate it because
students will object.&nbsp; Thus, we make it voluntary.&nbsp; How:
<br>2.1. Each problem set includes a set of instructional objectives, such
as “Newton’s second law”, “Force laws” and other fairly large grained objectives.
<br>2.2. When the student is finished with a problem, Andes displays a
bar chart with one bar per objective.&nbsp; The length of the bar is an
estimate of the student’s level of mastery.&nbsp; In text below it, Andes
says, “On the basis of these estimates, Andes predicts that your exam score
on this unit would be between &lt;letter grade> and &lt;letter grade>.&nbsp;
If you would like to improve your score, Andes suggests doing problem &lt;problem
name>.”&nbsp; Initially, students should do all the assigned problems and
ignore Andes advice.&nbsp; After that, they can do more problems if they
want.
<br>2.3. Andes has to have an assessor, but it does not have to be as fine-grained
as the Bayesian network version of Andes 1.
<br>2.4. The assessor’s predictions must be calibrated with exam scores.&nbsp;
This can be done using the log file data from the Fall 2000 evaluation
and the student’s exam scores.
<p>3. Basic idea: All numbers have units.&nbsp; Why: Students need to learn
to use units, and units make it easier for Andes to check the correctness
of answers.&nbsp; How:&nbsp; Whenever students enter a number, it must
be followed by units (except dimensionless numbers, of course).&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the student leaves off units or uses the wrong units, they get unsolicited
help and the entry turns red but is not deleted.&nbsp; Wrong units are
sometimes signs of conceptual difficulties, so the help is a hint sequence
and not just a one-liner.
<p>4. Basic idea: All the hints in the help window should always be visible.&nbsp;
Why: Students may need to refer to them as they work.&nbsp; Also, it is
sometimes helpful to read an earlier hint in order to understand a follow-up
hint.&nbsp; How:
<br>4.1. The help window should always be visible.&nbsp; When a hint appears,
the rest of the screen becomes gray and inoperative, just as it does in
Andes 1.&nbsp; When the student clicks on “OK” (which used to labeled “hide”),
the gray disappears and the diagram, variable and equation windows become
operational again, but the help window does not disappear, as it does in
Andes 1.
<br>4.2. The help window scrolls.
<p>5. Basic idea: Students don’t get any choices about follow-up hints.&nbsp;
Why: Deciding whether to ask “Why” or “How” is probably not something that
students are competent to decide (see recent studies on help seeking behavior
by Woods et al. and Aleven et al.).&nbsp; How:&nbsp; The help window usually
has just two buttons in it: “Explain further” and “OK.”&nbsp; Explain further
gives the next hint in the sequence, and OK returns the student to problem
solving, as described in 4.
<p>6. Basic idea: We prohibit the use of numbers in the equations, except
those that occur as coefficients or exponents in principles.&nbsp; Why:
because the numbers make the students lose track of what the equations
mean, and thus make it harder for them to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp; How:
<br>6.1. Although numbers are prohibited in most equations, students still
need to assign numbers to variables somehow.&nbsp; Why:&nbsp; They sometimes
get the assignments wrong and need help on them.&nbsp; How:&nbsp; Students
can enter equations with numbers as long as the equation has the form &lt;variable>
= &lt;number, with a unit if necessary>.&nbsp; When the solve tool is used,
it also produces equations of this form.
<br>6.2. If the student enters an equation that is correct except that
some of its variables been replaced by numbers, then Andes will give unsolicited
help saying so.&nbsp; When the student OKs the help message, the equation
is deleted.
<p>7. Basic idea: Andes forces students to enter the steps of a method
in a recommended order.&nbsp; For instance, NSL’s order is: Enter a body,
Draw vectors, Draw coordinate axes, Write NSL with components expressed
as variables, then Write NSL with components expressed as expressions.&nbsp;
Why: This procedural constraint helps them clarify their understanding
of the problem before getting bogged down in the algebra, gives them a
more conceptual view of the problem, prevents errors (e.g., sign errors
and trig errors), gives them practice at a healthy habit, and provides
an appropriate context for help in case they ask for help later.&nbsp;
How:&nbsp; If the student enters a correct step that is premature according
to the ordering contained in the method, then an unsolicited help message
will tell them that their step is correct but premature.&nbsp; When they
OK the message, the step is <u>turned black but not deleted.&nbsp; The
only way that they can get the entry to turn green is by entering the prerequisite
step, then re-entering the black step.&nbsp; Re-entering an equation is
done by putting the cursor in its box and pressing the enter key.&nbsp;
Re-entering a non-equation is done by clicking on it with the right mouse
button, which causes a dialog box to be displayed, then clicking on the
OK button in the dialog box.</u>
<p>8. Basic idea:&nbsp; Some of the constraints enforced by the workbench
are removed (faded) when the student has mastered them.&nbsp; Why:&nbsp;
When the constraints are removed, students will probably violate them,
make errors, and discover that it is better to obey the constraints.&nbsp;
If they don’t go through this process on Andes, then they’ll do it on the
exams.&nbsp; How:
<br>8.1. One of the property sheets on Andes lists the constraints that
the Workbench enforces, with a check box for each.&nbsp; Initially, all
the constraints are enforced (their boxes are checked).
<br>8.2. When the student has not mastered the skills that the constraint
forces them to use, the check box is gray and cannot be change.
<br>8.3. When a skill has been mastered (according to the assessor), the
student gets an unsolicited help message saying so and telling them that
they are free to turn the constraint off if they want.
<br>8.4. The constraints are:&nbsp; excluding numbers from equations (see
6.2) and doing steps in order (see 7)
<p>9. Basic idea: Bottom-out hints are reported in the hardcopy printout
of the solution.&nbsp; Why: Students often copy the bottom-out hints as
a way to do their homework.&nbsp; How:
<br>9.1. When the Help system gives a bottom out hint that mentions an
equation (probably don’t need to worry about the other bottom out hints),
it is reported in a special section of the hardcopy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even if they don’t enter the equation from the hint, the hint is reported.
<br>9.2. This reporting is not foolproof.&nbsp; Students can print their
solution, then start the problem over and copy equations from the printout.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Changes to the Solve tool</h3>

<p><br>10. Basic idea:&nbsp; The Solve tool determines what unknowns are
left.&nbsp; Why:&nbsp; With this capability, students do not have to do
any algebraic manipulation in order to solve problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
would allow them to concentrate on learning the physics.&nbsp; How:&nbsp;
When the student uses the Solve tool and the equations can’t be solved,
it prints “; &lt;list of variables> are still unknown” instead of an equation
in the equation window.&nbsp; The semi-colon marks it as a comment.
<p>11. Basic idea:&nbsp; The Solve tool can output algebraic expressions
involving variables.&nbsp; Why: This allows problems to use symbolic constants
as givens.&nbsp; How:
<br>11.1. The problem statement must say, “Solve in terms of m1, m2 and
q.” or in some other fashion convey to the student which variables are
allowed in the answer.
<br>11.2. This same list must be included in the problem representation
because the Solve tool needs it.
<p>12. Basic idea:&nbsp; Solve tool usage is indicated on the hardcopy
of the problem solution.&nbsp; Why: Some instructors may not want students
to use the Solve tool.&nbsp; How:
<br>12.1. When the Solve tool produces a numerical or algebraic value for
a variable, that usage is reported in a special section of the hardcopy.&nbsp;
Even if the student deletes the number or the equation produced by Solve
tool, the printout still reports the tool’s usage.
<br>12.2. Using the Solve tool to figure out which variables are unknown
is not reported on the hardcopy.&nbsp; However, the output is written in
the equation window, so unless the student deletes it, it will appear on
the hardcopy.
<h3>
Changes to the feedback (red/green) markings</h3>
13. Basic idea: Inefficient solutions are allowed.&nbsp; Why: Marking a
kinematics equation red because it is not the most efficient kinematics
equation for the problem will confuse students who are just learning kinematics.&nbsp;
How:
<br>13.1. If the student enters something from an inefficient solution,
it is marked green not red.
<br>13.2. The solution graphs should contain all solutions, including both
efficient and inefficient ones.&nbsp; However, a step is included in an
inefficient solution only if it actually participates in solving the problem.&nbsp;
For instance, if the problem can be solved by resolving force on one body,
then resolving forces on a different body does not make those steps part
of an inefficient solution.
<br>13.3. Efficient solution are marked as such so that when the help system
has free choice of which solution to suggest, it suggests an efficient
solution.
<p>14. Basic idea:&nbsp; Some solutions are forbidden.&nbsp; Why:&nbsp;
Sometimes instructors want students to use newly introduced knowledge,
e.g., energy, so the older approaches should be forbidden.&nbsp; How:
<br>14.1. Problems with forbidden solutions have that fact announced in
their text e.g., “Do not use Newton’s second law or kinematics on this
problem.”&nbsp; One could also use the more traditional statement, “Use
Conservation of Energy to solve this problem,” but that tends to give away
something that students should figure out.
<br>14.2. The problem representation indicates which solutions are forbidden.&nbsp;
The solution graph most contain forbidden solution, but they are marked
them as forbidden.
<br>14.3. When a student enters an equation or vector that is part of a
forbidden solution, an unsolicited help message appears indicating that
it is part of a forbidden solution.&nbsp; When the student says “OK” to
the help message, the entry is deleted.
<h3>
Changes in the “what’s next” help</h3>
15. Basic idea: When the student asks “what’s next?” the hints help them
identify the main method(s) for solving the problem and why those methods
should be used here.&nbsp; Why: Students often fail to learn this key knowledge.&nbsp;
How:
<br>15.1.&nbsp; The “what’s next” hints have a preamble where Andes asks
the following two questions (giving feedback until it gets an acceptable
answer): “What quantity are you seeking?” and “What method should be used
to find it?”
<br>15.2. The solution graph contains the appropriate goals and method
application nodes for this preamble.
<p>16. Basic idea: When the student asks “what’s next?” the hints should
target a step that is the next recommended step, even if the student has
skipped that step and has done ones that come after it.&nbsp; Why:&nbsp;
The student can skip steps only when the procedural constraints (see 7)
are faded (see 8).&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully, such skipping will cause errors,
which will convince the student that they should do the steps in the recommend
order without skipping any.&nbsp; The hints should say that.&nbsp; How:&nbsp;
The solution graph records the recommended order of steps, and the&nbsp;
“what’s next?” hint generator uses this knowledge to choose an appropriate
target step.
<p>17. Basic idea:&nbsp; When Andes gives “what’s next” hints on a target
step, it should focus more on teaching physics than on getting the problem
solving moving again.&nbsp; How:
<br>17.1. After the preamble (see 15), the first hint should state the
goal of the target step.&nbsp; e.g., “You should draw forces.”
<br>17.2. The second hint should prompt the operator used to achieve that
goal. e.g., “Is the surface interacting with the car?&nbsp; If so, shouldn’t
you draw a force?”
<br>17.3. The third hint should teach the operator used to produce the
target step.&nbsp; e.g., “Whenever a surface supports a body, it exerts
a normal force on the body that is perpendicular to the surface.”&nbsp;
This hint should be a minilesson if one exists for this operator and if
the student has not seen it yet.
<br>17.4. The fourth (bottom-out) hint should restate the operator, substituting
in information specific to this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., “Because the
driveway supports the car, there is a normal force on the car due to the
driveway.&nbsp; Because the driveway is inclined at 25 degrees, and the
normal force is perpendicular to it, the normal force’s orientation is
115 degrees.”
<br>17.5. If the target step is an equation, the bottom out hint should
present the equation in textbook form.&nbsp; It should not substitute in
any numbers or other expressions, but just use the variables from the problem.&nbsp;
If an appropriate variable is not yet defined, then it will invent a name
for it and add, “... assuming you have defined &lt;variable> to stand for
&lt;quantity>.”
<h3>
Changes in the “what’s wrong?” help</h3>
18. Basic idea:&nbsp; If the student asks “what’s wrong?” with a step,
and Andes can’t tell what correct step matches the student’s step, then
it tells them so and suggests that they use “what’s next?” help.&nbsp;
Why: Even if the student knows about “what’s next?” help, they might not
remember to use it in this context.&nbsp; How: trivial to implement.
<p>19. Basic idea: If the student asks “what’s wrong?” with a step, and
Andes has identified the correct step that the student is probably trying
to enter, and the correct step is inappropriate, then it says so.&nbsp;
Why: It would be silly of Andes to help them enter a step that they shouldn’t
be entering.&nbsp; How:
<br>19.1. If the correct step is forbidden (see 14), Andes says so and
suggests they use next-step help.
<br>19.2. If the correct step is inefficient (see 13), the help system
says something like, “The step you are trying to enter is not the most
efficient way to solve this problem but it will work.&nbsp; Click here
for help on finding a better solution.&nbsp; Click here for help on continuing
your current approach.”
<br>19.3. If the correct step is premature (see 7), then Andes tells the
student what step(s) to do first.&nbsp; This occurs even if the ordering
constraints are turned off in the fading control (see 8).
<br>19.4. If the correct step has some of its variables replaced by numbers
(see 6), Andes first hint is, “Your equation appears to have multiple errors
in it.&nbsp; It will be easier to discover them if you don’t substitute
numerical values for variables.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This occurs even if
the constraint is turned off in the fading control (see 8).
<p>20. Basic idea: When the student asks “what’s wrong?” with a step, and
Andes has identified the correct step that the student probably intended
to make, and the correct step is appropriate to make at this time, then
the hints should focus on remedying the cause of the error rather than
the error itself.&nbsp; How:
<br>20.1. The Help system needs to be able to recognize common errors and
have hints specially for them.&nbsp; It is not clear yet which errors need
to be represented by buggy operators in the problem solver and which can
be recognized from the surface form of the incorrect step.
<br>If the Help system does not have help that is specific for the student’s
error, then it hints the target step, as described above (see 17).&nbsp;
However, the wording of those hints may need to be changed in order to
make them appropriate in this context.
