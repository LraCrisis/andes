Next step help module</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/16/01)</center>

<p>This module teaches a strategy for solving the problem by walking the
student through a line of reasoning that eventuates in productive next
step for them to do, then hinting the step.&nbsp; The dialog has three
phases:
<ul>
<li>
From a top level goal (i.e., a quantity node in the bubble graph) to a
target PSM.&nbsp; This is called "walking the bubble graph."&nbsp; It results
in an alternating sequence of questions of the form "what quantity are
you seeking?" and "what method should be applied to find it?"&nbsp; This
is sometimes referred to as the "preamble."&nbsp; (Sometimes the preamble
alone is given <a href="WhatsWrongHelp.html#preamble in error handlers">as
part of what's wrong help</a>)</li>

<li>
From the top level goal of PSM to a target operator application.&nbsp;
This is called "walking the PSM graph."&nbsp; It results in a sequence
of assertions of the form "You should be doing such-and-such goal."&nbsp;
Only the unachieved goals are mentioned.</li>

<li>
A hint sequence for the target step.&nbsp; After each hint, the student
is asked whether they want another hint or they want to go back to problem
solving.</li>
</ul>
For instance, suppose the problem has the good old block on a frictionless
inclined plane, and it asks for the time it takes the block to slide a
certain distance after starting at rest.&nbsp; The walk starts in the bubble
graph with the duration quantity, which is the sought.&nbsp; Andes says,
"What quantity are you seeking?"&nbsp; The student picks from the quantities
menu (which is nearly identical to the one used to define variables) the
duration quantity.&nbsp; Andes then asks, "What principle should you apply
to determine it?"&nbsp; The student picks from a PSM menu and its associated
dialog boxes something that denotes the application of translational kinematics
to the block during time 1 to time 2.&nbsp; Andes sees that this PSM has
been completed already by the student (lets' say), so it says, "Right.
And that principle has been applied already. Now what quantity should you
seek?"&nbsp; Again the student hits the quantity menu, this time selecting
acceleration of the block.&nbsp; Andes then asks for a PSM, and the student
selects Newton's second law applied to the block.&nbsp; Since the student
has only partially finished applying this PSM, it is the target PSM.&nbsp;
This concludes the phase of walking the bubble graph.
<p>Now Andes walks the PSM graph.&nbsp; Actually, it does a fancy search
in the PSM graph to figure out what the target step is most likely to be.&nbsp;
During this search, it also calculates the goal stack of unachieved goals
that leads up to that target step.&nbsp; When it finally finds the target
step, it goes through a loop that announces the goals leading down to the
target step. Let's suppose the student has drawn rotated axes, all the
forces and the accelration, the compo equation and most of the projection
equations.&nbsp; The only projecting equation left is the one for weight,
which is the hardest one as it requires some trig.&nbsp; Thus, the loop
through the goal stack generates, "I assume you are rewriting Newton's
law so that it has only vector magnitudes.&nbsp; You should be writing
a projection equation for the weight of the block."&nbsp; Andes puts up
the usual menu that aks the student whether she wants another hint or to
go back to problem solving.&nbsp; This ends the PSM walking phase.&nbsp;
Someday it would be better to make this phase more interactive--ask more,
tell less.
<p>If the student wants a hint, then Andes will give one, which is generated
from the hint sequence stored on the operator.&nbsp; Since the goal has
already been mention, Andes skips the operator's goal hint and starts by
giving a pointing hint.&nbsp; The first pointing hint is "The projection
equation will involve either sine or cosine, and its argument is the difference
between the orientations of the weight vector and the axis."&nbsp; If the
student wants yet another hint, then Andes looks for a teaching hint, and
finds a minilesson.&nbsp; It plays the minilesson, then asks if the student
wants yet another hint. This time it picks a bottom out hint, and tells
the student exactly what equation to enter.
<p>Pseudo code for the next-step help module is <a href="NextStepHelp2.html">here</a>.
<p>Some examples of what-next help are included among the <a href="WhatsWrongHelp.html#error interpretation">errors</a>
analyzed for what's wrong help.&nbsp; They demonstrate taht when students
do not make correct selections during the preamble, their errors must be
handled intelligently, because they are golden learning opportunities.&nbsp;
Physics-specific knowledge will be needed to do that.&nbsp; It will probably
have to be hung off the PSM definitions, but that has not yet been worked
out yet.
