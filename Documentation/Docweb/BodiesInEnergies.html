<br>A block is launched from a spring at T0, flies off the spring at T1
and
<br>reaches the apex of its trajectory at T2.&nbsp; The student tries to
define the
<br>potential energy of the spring at T2, and Andes marks it wrong.
<br>One general policy for forces and energies that are due to contacts
is that
<br>when there is no contact, there is no force or energy.&nbsp; An alternative
<br>policy is to assume that the force and energy exist but are zero.
<br>Different professors may use different policies.&nbsp; The student
probably just
<br>doesn't know what policy Andes is using. (I actually don't know what
the
<br>Andes 2 KB uses, but I'll bet it is the first policy.)
<h3>
Anders:</h3>
Andes2 basically uses the *second* policy since it puts out an equation
<br>saying the spring PE = 0 at that time. In fact Andes 1, at least version
<br>5.0.6 from Fall 2000, uses this second policy as well. I'm not sure
about
<br>the Fall 99 version but I expect it is the same -- see below for an
<br>alternate diagnosis of the error.
<p>I think this is almost certainly the right policy. I believe energy
is
<br>properly spoken of as a property of the total system (Earth+spring+block)
<br>and its configuration. I think any instructor would want it to be
<br>permissible -- though not required -- to state that the elastic potential
<br>energy in the system, i.e.,&nbsp; the potential energy stored in the
spring, is
<br>zero at that particular time. This especially if you have to mention
the
<br>non-zero potential energy stored in the spring at any other time.
<p>I expect the error stemmed from a quirk in the Andes dialog box for
defining
<br>potential energy. We don't anywhere explicitly mention the total system
and
<br>its components and so don't speak of energy in the *system* at all;
rather,
<br>all our quantities are sort of forced to hang onto a principal body,
<br>although some, like distance or forces, may involve relations to a
second
<br>body. In order to specify energy quantities using the existing slots
in our
<br>dialog box and other structures, you currently have to define them
in Andes
<br>1 as one of:
<ul>
<li>
Total Mechanical Energy&nbsp; OF the block AT TIME ...</li>

<li>
Kinetic energy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OF the block AT TIME ...</li>

<li>
Potential energy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OF the block DUE TO the Earth&nbsp; AT TIME ...(=grav PE)</li>

<li>
Potential energy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OF the block DUE TO the spring AT TIME ...(=elastic PE)</li>
</ul>
This involves&nbsp; an odd, not to say incorrect, representational convention
for
<br>specifying the elastic potential energy. It derives in part from the
<br>representations chosen to fit these quantity into&nbsp; the CLIPS scalar
quantity
<br>template:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (scalar (kind energy) (body block) (body2 spring)
(type se) ...
<br>BTW the CLIPS also uses a counterpart of "total mechanical energy of
the
<br>block" rather than "total mechanical energy of the block-earth-spring
<br>system".
<p>Anyway, the student probably just didn't know this convention.
<p>As Joel can tell you there are several instances where the representational
<br>conventions required&nbsp; by the Andes interface are not intuitively
apparent
<br>even to someone who is expert in physics! This one in particular may
merit a
<br>change, since one does normally say the elastic pe is stored in the
spring.
<h3>
Joel:</h3>
YES!&nbsp; This is in fact the first problem I tried after I decided to
come
<br>here, and it made me give up in despair (on using Andes right then,
not
<br>quite on coming here), probably for this reason.
<p>&nbsp; Properly speaking, energy is of interest when it is conserved
or when
<br>its changes can be quantitatively accounted for. It is conserved, at
best,
<br>only for an ISOLATED system, not for an individual body unless that
body
<br>has no forces acting on it (more accurately, no forces that can do
work on
<br>it - static magnetic fields do no work)
<p>&nbsp; The energy is a sum of pieces. Kinetic energy for each body,
and
<br>potential energy for each conservative interaction. [Not for each force!
<br>Action and reaction are sharing the same potential energy, and you
would
<br>be double-counting to attribute it to each of the bodies]. And the
<br>potential energy of an unstretched spring does exist, it is zero, and
this
<br>is not a choice, because to say it is undefined means energy cannot
be
<br>compared.
<p>&nbsp; The notion that potential energy belongs to one body is an misconception
<br>inspired by too many simple problems in which one of the interactive
<br>bodies is so massive that the interactions have no effect on its kinetic
<br>energy. Recall that the rate at which a force does work on a body is
F.v,
<br>so if the body is unmovable there is no work done on it, and any work
the
<br>potential energy does must be done on the other object. But consider
a
<br>spring with k = 10000 N/m and initial compression 4 cm, so the potential
<br>energy is 8 J. If a single ball of mass 1 kg is on one end of this
spring
<br>and the other is nailed to the earth, the ball will fly off at 4 m/s.
<br>But if two balls of mass 1 kg each are at the ends, at rest, when the
<br>clamp is released, they will each fly off at sqrt(8) m/s, with 4 J
each
<br>of kinetic energy. (Interesting, because the initial force is the same
<br>in both cases!)

Your discussion suggests the following changes:
<ul>
<li>
Create a new System tool whose dialog box looks exactly like the dialog
box for the current Body tool.&nbsp; The user selects a subset of the objects
defined in a problem, selects a beginning and ending time point, and types
in a name.&nbsp; The name appears in subsequent menus (see below).</li>

<li>
The dialog boxes for energy quantities are modified as follows:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Total Mechanical Energy&nbsp; OF the system AT TIME ...</li>

<li>
Kinetic energy OF the system DUE TO the block AT TIME ...</li>

<li>
Potential energy OF the system DUE TO the Earth&nbsp; AT TIME ...(=grav
PE)</li>

<li>
Potential energy OF the system DUE TO the spring AT TIME ...(=elastic PE)</li>
</ul>
I'm not certain whether we need a second argument for kinetic entergy.&nbsp;
If a system consists of bolo (two balls connected by a string and rotating
about their center of mass), then I suppose we would want the kinetic energy
of each ball to be a distinct quantity.
<li>
If the student tries to specify a system that lacks some of the appropriate
objects, it is an error.</li>

<li>
If the student tries to use an object in the first slot of an energy quantity
that is only a part of the system, then it is an error.</li>
</ul>
Actually, the only difference between the System tool and the Body tool
is that the Body tool creates a dot on the screen and defines a mass variable.&nbsp;
If we have the system tool, we really don't need the Body tool anymore.&nbsp;
If students want a mass variable, then they can define it from the variable
menu.&nbsp; Forces, velocities, etc. for a single object can be defined
without first defining that object as a body.&nbsp; Compound bodies can
be defined using the System tool.
<p>The main advantage of the Body tool is that it reifies a planning step,
namely, deciding on what bodies/system to analyze for kinematics and Newton's
law.&nbsp; However, Andes has never required that student's use the Body
tool, so many of them may not be getting any benefit from it.&nbsp; Even
those who do use it might think of it as "drawing a dot" rather than committing
to analyzing the motion of a system.&nbsp; In Andes 2, students will often
see a preamble (what's your sought? what's&nbsp; your method?) that reifies
the plan in a much more direct way.&nbsp; Maybe we no longer need the Body
tool.
