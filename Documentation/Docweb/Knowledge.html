<p>The Knowledge defines datastructures such as Problem, Entry Proposition,
etc that are loaded and used by the Solution Graph Generator and the Help
system.
<br>Ultimately this file will link to those files but at present only a
few files are connected.

<h3>
Small data structures:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="Entry proposition"></a><b>Entry proposition</b> -- This is a proposition
in the KB that happens to represent a entry.&nbsp; For instance,</li>

<br><tt>(vector puck (at (force puck earth weight) (during 1 2)) 270)</tt>
<br>represents a weight vector.&nbsp; The KB operators create these, and
they get stored in the PSM nodes.&nbsp; Then they get extracted and put
into System entries (see below).&nbsp; The Student entries have them as
well, but they are created by domain-specific code in the Entry interpreter
that knows how to translate information from the Workbench into entry propositions
with the correct syntax.&nbsp; The list of current entry propositions is
<a href="EntryPropositions.html">here</a>.
<li>
<a NAME="Student entry"></a><b>Student entry</b> -- represents a workbench
action where the student made a problem solving entry, such as writing
an equation or drawing a vector.&nbsp; Fields are</li>

<ul>
<li>
Identifier -- atom assigned by the workbench.&nbsp; When the workbench
says something is deleted, this is the ID that it uses.</li>

<li>
Proposition -- an entry proposition built by the Entry interpreter.</li>

<li>
Correctness -- whether the entry is correct, inefficient, dead-path, forbidden
or incorrect</li>

<li>
Interpretation -- If the entry is correct, this is a set of system entries,
this is the set of the system entries that correspond to it.&nbsp; Its
a set because a compound student equation corresponds to a set of primitive
equations.&nbsp; If the entry is incorrect, this is NIL or an error interpretation
produced by an error handler.</li>

<li>
Correct-interpretations -- If the entry is correct, all logically possible
interpretations are stored here.&nbsp; One of these is selected by the
cognitive load procedure and put into the Interpretation slot by the Entry
Interpreter.</li>

<li>
Error-interpretations -- If the entry is incorrect, all interpretations
produced by the error handlers are stored here.&nbsp; One of these is selected
by What's wrong help and put in the the Interpretation slot.</li>

<li>
Verbatim -- If the entry is an equation, this records the student's string
exactly as they typed it before it was parsed.&nbsp; This is useful for
some error handlers, such as <a href="ErrorHandlers/EqnUsedAsMethodName.html">Equation-used-as-method-nam</a>e.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="System entry"></a><b>System entry </b>-- represents a entry made
by the problem solver.&nbsp; The same entry may be made by different operator
applications.&nbsp; However, we assume that when this occurs, <a href="DesignDiscussions/EntryPropositionAmbiguity.html#eq entry prop implies eq op app">the
operator applications are equalp</a> and <a href="DesignDiscussions/EntryPropositionAmbiguity.html#eq entry propositions have eq pre-reqs">their
prerequisites are equalp</a>.&nbsp; Thus, the help generated from each
operator application is the same, so we don't need to disambiguate them.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Index -- the entry's position in the Entry array.&nbsp; This number is
used for communication with the algebra module.</li>

<li>
Proposition -- an entry proposition that is contained in all the PSM nodes.</li>

<li>
Sources -- a set of <a href="SolutionGraphDataStructure.html#cognitive step">Cognitive
steps</a> that represent the operator applications that produced this entry.</li>

<li>
Op-app -- an operator application, which is the atomic name of the operator
cons'ed to the values of all its variables.&nbsp; The order is determined
by the order of variables in the Vars field of the operator (see below).&nbsp;
The value of this field should equal the values of all the op-app fields
of the sources.&nbsp; It is repeated here just in case a certain guarantee
fails (i.e., that equal entry propositions imply equal operator applications;
see <a href="DesignDiscussions/EntryPropositionAmbiguity.html#eq entry prop implies eq op app">discussion</a>)
and we have to work around it.</li>

<li>
Correctness -- one of correct, inefficient, incorrect, dead-path or forbidden.&nbsp;
This is how to treat the system entry as a whole.&nbsp; It may differ from
the Correctness fields of the sources, as described <a href="DesignDiscussions/EntryPropositionAmbiguity.html#correctness order">here</a>.</li>

<li>
Prereqs -- a set of system entries.&nbsp; This possibly-empty set is the
system entries that must be entered before the student is allowed to enter
this system entry.&nbsp; An operator application X requires an op app Y
if they are in the same PSM, and X precedes Y in the Path representation
of the partially order of steps.&nbsp; However, the pre-reqs of a system
entry are other system entries, not nodes in the PSM graph, because we
assume that if two operator applications produce the same entry proposition,
then their pre-requisites are also equivalent (i.e., produce the same entry
propositions, and thus correspond to the same system entry).&nbsp; See
<a href="DesignDiscussions/EntryPropositionAmbiguity.html#eq entry propositions have eq pre-reqs">discussion</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Tutor turn"></a><b>Tutor turn&nbsp;</b> -- represents the tutor's
turn in the dialog.&nbsp; Returned by many modules to the Manager, which
then forwards on the appropriate info to the Workbench, while remembering
the tutor turn so that it can interpret the next student turn in the dialog.&nbsp;
Fields are:</li>

<ul>
<li>
type -- one of dialog, play-minilesson, color-red, color-green, delete,
end-dialog</li>

<li>
text -- a string.&nbsp; If this is a dialog or delete type, then will play
this string.&nbsp; If it is a minilesson, then this is the file name.</li>

<li>
menu -- the name of a workbench menu or edit control</li>

<li>
responder -- a one-argument function that is applied to the student's turn
in order to respond to it.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Operator"></a><b>Operator</b> -- represents a primitive piece
of physics knowledge.&nbsp; Used extensively in the KB but referenced by
other modules as well.&nbsp; Fields are</li>

<ul>
<li>
name -- an atom</li>

<li>
vars -- a list of all the variables used in the operator [Collin: I think
you need to add this. -- KVL, 4/3/01]</li>

<li>
args -- list of ? variables.&nbsp; These are used inside the solver to
prevent repetition of operator applications.&nbsp; Args is a subset of
Vars, as discussed <a href="SolutionGraphDataStructure.html#cognitive step">here</a>.</li>

<li>
preconditions -- list of propositions and executable preconditions</li>

<li>
effects -- list of propositions</li>

<li>
hints -- list of hints</li>

<li>
features -- possibly empty list that could include Unordered,...</li>

<li>
cognitive load -- an integer.&nbsp; Can be missing, in which case the cognitive
load defaults to 2.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Hint"></a><b>Hint</b> -- represents a hint to be given to the
student.&nbsp; Written by authors and included as part of an operator.&nbsp;
Passed around by the what's next and other modules that plan how to give
hints. <a href="HintDataStructure.html">Details&nbsp; here</a>.</li>
