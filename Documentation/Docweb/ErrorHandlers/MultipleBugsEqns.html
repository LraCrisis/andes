bugs in them.

<a NAME="Ingpole 28-31"></a>Ingpole Eq-USNA 28-31</h3>
In the problem where the car is rolling down the driveway towards the garage,
the student defines variables, draws a correct FBD including both forces
and all kinematics vectors, applies NSL in one line to get a value for
acceleration, then enters “vf_x^2=-2*a(d).”&nbsp; The target equation is
vf_x^2=-2*a(-d).&nbsp; The student has dropped the negative sign on d.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the student has also defined vf as the average velocity
from T0 to T1 instead of the velocity at T1.&nbsp; The tutors and the student
didn’t notice this mistake because Andes marked the variable definition
green, which is what it should do, because average velocity can be used
in some kinematics solution to the problem.&nbsp; Thus, there are two errors:
a missing negation and a variable confusion.
<ul>
<li>
IH first asks how the student relates a to a_x, then asks how the student
relates d to d_x.</li>

<li>
RO asks what the direction of d is (despite the fact that d is drawn),
then points out the correct equation.</li>

<li>
Andes1 says that vf_x is not a relevant quantity.</li>

<li>
KVL: The first thing to remedy is to get the student to rewrite the equation
in component form.&nbsp; Assuming she does that, Andes should say, “vf_x
stands for the average velocity from T0 to T1.&nbsp; Is that what you want
here?”</li>
</ul>
Andes2 should find that substituting the final velocity's x-component for
vf_x and negating the right side of the equation produces a correct equation.&nbsp;
Indy analysis finds that it is a compound of vf_x^2 = vi_x^2 + 2*a_x*d_x,&nbsp;&nbsp;
vi_x=0,&nbsp;&nbsp; a_x=-a,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; d_x=-d.&nbsp; SG analysis
shows that the student's equation is premature, and the equation should
be written first in component form without the substitutions.
<p>Suppose Andes says to do that, and the student changes the equation
to vf_x^2 = vi_x^2 + 2*a_x*d_x. This equation will be marked red, so suppose
the student asks what's wrong with it.&nbsp; Andes finds that substituting
the final velocity's x-component for vf_x produces a correct equation.&nbsp;
Indy analysis finds that it is primitive.&nbsp; SG analysis finds that
it is not premature.&nbsp; Now Andes must decide whether the student intended
to put the average velocity in the equation, and thus needs to be taught
a correct version of the equation, or whether the student intended to define
the final velocity and put it in the equation, but slipped.&nbsp; Even
without knowing this student, it seems likely that the student slipped,
because the student chose vf as the variable's name.&nbsp; I think it would
be worth including some typical names in the Defexprs for quantities so
that Andes can be as smart as humans.&nbsp; Given this info, Andes would
decide that the student slipped, and thus give hint sequence based on the
substitution: "Check your definition of vf." then "You have used vf as
if it were the velocity of the car at T1, but you defined it as the average
velocity of the car from T0 to T1." then "Redefine vf by clicking on it
with the right moust button.&nbsp; Change it to be the velocity of the
car at T1."
<p><a href="MissingForces.html#2 forces missing">Two forces missing from
a sum of forces</a>.&nbsp; This should be handled inside the missing-forces
error handler.
<p>Convert Fp_x=F_x to Fp_x= -Ff_x via negative sign insertion and substitution
of Ff_x for F_x.&nbsp; See <a href="MissingForces.html#2 errors">here</a>.
