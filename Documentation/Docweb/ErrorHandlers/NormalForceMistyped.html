Normal force mistyped</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/27/01)</center>

<p>Students sometimes get normal force and&nbsp; friction force confused.&nbsp;
This is partly the fault of a tradition in physics.&nbsp; Although there
is only one contact force between the ground and the cart and it is at
a diagonal, physicists always treat it as two forces: one perpendicular
to the surface (called the normal force or reaction force) and the other
parallel to the surface (called the friction force).&nbsp; It may be that
the students know that there is a vertical force here and that it is related
to the friction force, but they don't't realize that it is called "normal
force."&nbsp; They may call it a static friction force or a contact force,
etc.
<p>If the student's entry is a force
<ul>
<li>
that has type ?non-normal</li>

<li>
and changing the type to Normal makes it a correct entry</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
to hint/teach/state that "If there is a friction force on ?body at ?time
due to ?surface, then point/teach/state that whenever a surface interacts
with an object, there is both a normal force and a friction force on the
object.&nbsp; The friction force will be zero if the contact is assumed
to be frictionless, and thus can be ignored.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will either
be a static friction if the object is not moving relative to the surface,
or a dynamic friction force if the object is moving relative to the surface.&nbsp;
That is, there are always 2 forces: the normal force, and a friction force
that is either zero, static or dynamic."</li>
</ul>

A person pushes a 10 kg shopping cart at constant speed with a force of
100 N acting down at 45 degrees.&nbsp; What is the value [sic] of the friction
force acting horizontally on the cart?&nbsp; What is the normal force exerted
by the ground on the cart?&nbsp; The student has entered correct answers
for both sought quantities.&nbsp; He has also drawn a correct applied force
and defined correct variables for the weight, normal and kinetic friction
force.&nbsp; His calculations for the normal force direction are done correctly,
but the calculations for the normal force magnitude are syntactically ill-formed
(he probably did the calculations on paper).&nbsp; The student has also
drawn a static friction force on the cart due to the ground that points
straight up.&nbsp; There is no such force, and the student is asking why
it is wrong.
<p>One possibility, which we could check by examining the log files, is
that the student tried to draw the normal force, and Andes wouldn't let
him because it was defined already (and named F3), so he tried to draw
it as a static friction force instead (named F4).&nbsp; This can't happen
with the Andes 2 user interface, because students must draw the vector;
they can no longer define variables for them.&nbsp; So let us assume that
the student is not intending to draw a normal force, but actually intended
to draw the force that he did draw, and build an error handler for that
case, which may someday occur.
<p>The normal force operator application is efficient and not premature,
so the bug applies.
