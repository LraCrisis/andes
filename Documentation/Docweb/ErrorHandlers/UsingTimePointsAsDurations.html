<h2>
Using time points as durations</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/26/01)</center>

<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that has one or more time points in it (where a time pint is defined initially
by Andes)</li>

<li>
and substituting durations for the time points creates a correct equation</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;a training card hint (e.g,.&nbsp; “Time points stand for specific
clock times, such as January 1, 2000, 9:34 am.&nbsp; To express the duration
of a time interval, you should define a duration variable. Although you
can also express a duration by subtracting two time points (e.g., T1-T0),
this can lead to messier equations.”)</li>

<li>
bottom-out hint</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Shrike Eq-USNA 5-52</h3>
In the problem where a bullet is fired and hits a gong, after defining
variables (no FBD), the student entered "2s=(vb*T1)+(vs*T2)" as the first
equation.&nbsp; The target equation has s1 instead of s (s is undefined),
T1-T0 instead of T1 and T2-T1 instead of T2.
<ul>
<li>
IH points out that student meant s1 instead of s.&nbsp; Then IH asks student
to express "t" (presumably, the length of time between the firing the bullet
and hearing the sound) in terms of T0, T1 and T2.</li>

<li>
RO says, "you don't know T1 and T2.&nbsp; You only know the differences
between time points, such as T2-T0=0.731."</li>

<li>
Andes points out that there are no values for T1 and T2 and thus any equation
with these variables will be marked as incorrect.</li>

<li>
KVL: Since this is a speed-distance-duration problem and not kinematics,
the student doesn't have to draw vectors and axes first.&nbsp; Thus, Andes
should just teach the use of time points.</li>
</ul>
Let's assume the student has corrected the undefined variable and asked
what's wrong again.&nbsp; Andes notes that the equation has time points
in it, so it tries substituting durations for the time points until it
finds that 2*s=(vb*t01)+(vs*t12) is a correct equation.&nbsp; Indy analysis
finds that it is a compound of s1=vb*t01 and s1=vs*t12.&nbsp; SG analysis
indicates that they are not premature.&nbsp; Andes thus has to decide between
teaching the target equations or a slip interpretation.&nbsp; The use of
time points instead of intervals is marked as a highly likely slip
