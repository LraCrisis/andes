Initial velocity should be non-zero</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/27/01)</center>

<p>Students are given so many problems where the initial velocity is non-zero
that they sometimes assign zero-length initial velocities even on problem
that state that the initial velocity is not zero.
<p>If the student's entry is a velocity
<ul>
<li>
that is zero length</li>

<li>
and its time specifier is a point that is the initial time for a kinematics
PSM</li>

<li>
and changing it to non-zero lenth (plus adding a correct direction) makes
it correct</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "Is &lt;body> at rest at &lt;time>?")</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out)&nbsp; "Read the problem statement again and draw
a non-zero velocity in the correct direction.")</li>
</ul>

A soap box derby car starts with initial velocity of 1.00 m/s and accelerates
to 15.0 m/s over 62.0 seconds.&nbsp; What is its average acceleration?&nbsp;
The student draws a zero-length initial velocity, but it should be non-zero.
