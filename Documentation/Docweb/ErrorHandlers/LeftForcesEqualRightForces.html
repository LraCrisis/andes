Left forces equal right forces</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/26/01)</center>

<p>Students often write Newton's first law as &lt;sum of left forces> =
&lt;sum of right forces>.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with this, as long
as the sum is composed of magnitudes.&nbsp; If it is composed of components,
then one of the sums needs to be wrapped in a minus sign.
<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
of the form ?lhs = ?rhs</li>

<li>
where ?lhs is (compo ?force1 ?axis) or a sum of force components, and</li>

<li>
where ?rhs is (compo ?force2 ?axis) or a sumof force components,</li>
</ul>
then give the hint sequence
<ul>
<li>
preamble(Newton's first law)</li>

<li>
(hint string (teach) "In order to avoid sign errors, you should first write
Newton's first law in terms of the component variables, then rewrite if
you want replacing the component variables with expressions.")</li>

<li>
(hint string (teach) "When writing Newton's first law, it is best to put
the sum of the force components on one side of the equation, like this:
0=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x+Fk_x.&nbsp; All the force components have positive signs.&nbsp;
If you put some on the other side of the equation, they they would have
to have negative signs.&nbsp; Many students forget the negative signs because
they are thinking of a special case, wherein all the forces are parallel
to the axis, say the horizontal axis, but some point left and some point
right.&nbsp; For instance, if FL1 and FL2 point left and FR1 and FR2 point
right, then students often write FL1+FL2=FR1+FR2.&nbsp; This equation is
correct, but notice that it has <i>magnitudes</i> in it instead of <i>components</i>.&nbsp;
If it is rewritten in terms of components, it would have to be -FL1_x-FL2_x=FR1_x+FR2_x.&nbsp;
Most students forget the negative signs when they do this.&nbsp; If they
had followed the advice above, then they would write FL1_x+FL2_x+FR1_x+FR2_x=0
and gotten the signs right.&nbsp; Thus, if you want to get the signs right,
it is best to always write the sum of forces (a) in terms of components
and (b) all on one side of the equation.")</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) "In this case, you should write ....")</li>
</ul>
It feels right to give a preamble here in order to ascertain that the student
realizes that it is Newtons' first law that he is writing.

<a NAME="a5 3-43"></a>a5 Eq-Pitt 3-43</h3>
On the shopping cart problem, the student draws a complete FBD, enters
givens, a=0, all projections of forces on the x-axis, then S_x=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x,
where S is an undefined variable.&nbsp; The closest matching equation is
0=Fn_x+Fw_x+Fp_x+Fk_x, which includes Fk_x, the x-component of the kinetic
friction force, and excludes S_x, which is undefined.
<ul>
<li>
T1 thinks S_x denotes net force, and that the student should have left
out the normal and weight forces.&nbsp; Although the student has drawn
the normal and weight forces correctly, and the student has written Fn_x=0
and Fw_x=0, T1 still asks the student what their directions are.</li>

<li>
T2 says to put components of all forces in the equation.</li>

<li>
Andes says, "You have not defined the variable S."</li>

<li>
KVL: Maybe S_x denotes the friction force, as that is the only force on
the left side of the body, and students sometimes use &lt;left forces>
= &lt;right forces> for N1L.&nbsp; Andes should first complain about the
undefined variable, then react to the revised equation.</li>
</ul>
If the student defines S as the net force, then we have a missing force,
which is discussed <a href="MissingForces.html#a5 3-43">elsewhere</a>.
On the other hand, if the student changes the S_x to Fk_x, gets red, and
asks for help, then this bug is triggered.
