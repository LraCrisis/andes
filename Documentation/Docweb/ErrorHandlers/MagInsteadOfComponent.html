<h2>
Using the magnitude instead of the component of a vector</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/26/01)</center>

<p>This has to be tested after more specific bugs, including <a href="MissingNegOnVectorMag.html">MissingNegOnVectorMag</a>.
<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that contains (mag ?vector)</li>

<li>
and ?axis is an axis that ?vector can be projected along</li>

<li>
and replacing (mag ?vector) with (compo ?vector ?axis) makes the student's
equation correct</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
preamble</li>

<li>
(hint string (point) "~a is best stated with all the quantities expressed
in component form." law for the psm)</li>

<li>
(hint string (point) "Have you used the magnitude of a vector where you
should use the vector's component along an axis?")</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) ...)</li>
</ul>

<a NAME="a5 48-43"></a>a5 Eq-Pitt 48-43</h3>
On the ring pulled by 3 forces, the student has drawn a FBD without acceleration,
entered givens, entered projection equations for all 3 forces, and written
"FS3=Ft1_x+Ft2_x+Ft3_x."&nbsp; This would be correct if (a) FS3 were defined
as the net force and (b) its x-component were used here instead of its
magnitude.&nbsp; Let's assume for the sake of argument that the acceleration
and the net force are non-zero, and that they are not along the x-axis.
<ul>
<li>
T1 asks what is the sum of forces.</li>

<li>
T2 asks the student to define a variable for the net force, then to use
its x-component in this equation.</li>

<li>
Andes says that the FS3 is not defined.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should first say that FS3 is not defined, then it should tutor
the student on the sum-of-forces principle.</li>
</ul>
Andes first gives an undefined variable message, so let's assume that the
student defines FS as the net force, reenters the equation, gets red, and
asks for help.&nbsp; Because FS is non-zero and FS_x is not equal to FS,
the equation is incorrect.&nbsp; The intended equation is FS_x=Ft1_x+Ft2_x+Ft3_x,
which is primitive and non-premature, so the error handler gives the hint
sequence above.
