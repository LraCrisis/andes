<p>There are more specific bugs that should be tested before this one.&nbsp;
The version below is written specifically for the magnitudes of forces,
but a more general version is needed.
<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that contains (mag (force ?body ?agent ?type-student))</li>

<li>
and substituting (mag (force ?body ?agent ?type-correct)) for it creates
a correct equation</li>
</ul>
then give the hint sequence
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "Did you really mean to use ~a here?" student's-variable-name)</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) "Your variable ~a is defined to be ~a, but you
should use a variable for ~a here instead." student-var-name student's-quantity
correct-quantity)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
brody Eq-USNA 49-11</h3>
If a 100 kg person slides down a rope that will support only 500N, what
is his minimal acceleration? The student defined variables, drew a correct
FBD, entered several equations, then entered “F_y=500” where F is the net
force on the person.&nbsp;&nbsp; The closest matching equation is Ff_y
= 500, where Ff is the student's variable for friction force. This equation
has not been written before.
<ul>
<li>
IH asks what’s the relation between the tension in the rope and the friction
force. She is trying to get the student to infer that Ff_y = 500.</li>

<li>
RO asks for the definition of F_y and of the 500 N.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Do you want to use ‘F’ rather than the value of ‘Ff’?”</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should say something like, “F is the net force.&nbsp; What is
500 N?”</li>
</ul>
Andes substitutes various force quantities for F_y until it finds that
Ff_y makes the equation correct.&nbsp; Indy analysis shows that Ff_y=500
is primitive, and SG analysis finds that it is not premature.
