<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that contains a term ?term</li>

<li>
and ?term is not inside a product (i.e., we want to transform T+m*g=0 to
T-m*g and not to either T+(-m)*g=0 or T+m*(-g)=0.)</li>

<li>
and replacing ?term by (- ?term) makes the equation correct</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "Check your signs.")</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) ...)</li>
</ul>
Clearly, this bug has to be tested after more specific sign errors have
been tested.

<a NAME="M030072 12-50"></a>M030072 Eq-USNA 12-50</h3>
In the problem with the jumping kangaroo, which seeks the initial velocity
of the kangaroo given the height of the jump, after defining variables
and drawing a FBD, the student entered d_y=2.5, a_y=-9.8, vfinal_y=0 and
then the incorrect equation “vinit_y^2=2*a_y*d_y – vfinal^2”&nbsp; The
closest matching correct equation is a combination of&nbsp; vfinal_y^2
= vinit_y^2 + 2*a_y*d_y and vfinal_y=vfinal, neither of which have been
entered.&nbsp; The student probably meant to enter -vinit_y^2 = 2*a_y*d_y-vfinal^2,
but dropped the minus sign on the left side of the equation when she moved
terms across the equal sign in order to isolate the sought variable.&nbsp;
Thus, the most likely diagnosis is that this is an algebraic manipulation
error; its unlikely that she believes the kinematics equation is vfinal_y^2=
-vinit_y^2 + 2*a_y*d_y.
<ul>
<li>
&middot; IH notices algebra manipulation error and through critique tries
to get student to figure out error on their own.</li>

<li>
&middot; RO notices same problem (sign error) but tells student there is
a sign error.</li>

<li>
&middot; Both IH and RO address v_f^2=v_o^2 + 2*a_y*d_y</li>

<li>
&middot; Andes suggests swapping variables instead of noticing the sign
problem.</li>

<li>
KVL: The student's intended entry is premature.&nbsp; Students should write
a compo version of kinematics before trying to substitute anything in.&nbsp;
Thus, Andes should say, "Although the equation you've written is incorrect,
the closest matching correct equation would be premature.&nbsp; It combines
two or more primitive equations.&nbsp; Try writing your equations in textbook
form without doing any substitutions.&nbsp; Then combine them.&nbsp; Although
this takes longer, you probably will not make the error that you've made
here."&nbsp; The bottom out hint would be: "Write vfinal_y^2 = vinit_y^2
+ 2*a_y*d_y."</li>
</ul>
Since the only magnitude is vfinal and it is zero, the <a href="MissingNegOnVectorMag.html">MissingNegSignOnVectorMag</a>
error handler will not yield a correct equation.&nbsp; Thus, only this
generic sign error handler will apply. It can put a negation on vinit_y^2
or on 2*a_y*d_y.&nbsp; Also, because vfinal is zero, it could put a negative
sign on the whole right side of the equation.&nbsp; Thus, there are 3 possible
applications of this error handler to the equation.&nbsp; Which application
we choose doesn't matter because they all end up with the "premature equation"
tutorial turn.
