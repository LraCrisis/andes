<h2>
Errors where a given quantity was assigned the wrong value</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/22/01)</center>

<p>Students sometimes enter the wrong values for given variables.&nbsp;
Thus, when a student equation has the form &lt;variable>=&lt;value> and
the &lt;variable> is a given quantity, and the correct equation for it
has not yet been entered, then we have a case of this type of error.&nbsp;
This are always slips, because the target equation results from just writing
a given quantity down, and there is no hint sequence associated with that
operator.
<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that has the form ?var = ?value where ?value is a number and ?var is a
variable,</li>

<li>
and ?var stands for a given quantity in the problem</li>
</ul>
then give the hint sequence
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "~a is a given quantity, but ~a is not the value it
is given by the problem statement." ?var ?value)</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) "You should equate ~a with ~a." definition-of-?var
correct-value-for-?var)</li>
</ul>

022598 Eq-USNA 37-11</h3>
If a trooper jumps from a plane at T0, falls 400m to hit the snow at 20
m/s at T1, and plows to a stop at T2 at the bottom of a 1 m crater, then
what is the net force on the trooper?&nbsp; After defining variables and
drawing a FBD, the student entered “d = 400m”&nbsp; where d is defined
as that displacement from T1 to T2, but 400m is the displacement from T0
to T1.&nbsp; The variable is required for solution, but 400m is not.
<ul>
<li>
IH identifies problem as wrong use of ‘d’ and questions definition of d
and explains it as the height of the snow in the crater.</li>

<li>
RO also sees problem with ‘d’ and uses similar explanation.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Did you really mean to use 400 for ‘d’ (the magnitude of the
displacement of the trooper during the time period from ‘T1’ to ‘T2’)?”</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp; It would be silly of Andes to help the student write the equation
that has 400m in it, as that equation is not needed for the solution of
the problem.&nbsp; So Andes should select the other interpretation and
say something like, "Check your time periods." then hint about changing
the value.</li>
</ul>
Two bugs trigger on this error: this one and <a href="VarHasWrongTimeSpecifier.html">VarHasWrongTimeSpecifier.</a>&nbsp;
This bug should have priority.

bee Eq-USNA 7-57</h3>
If a block is projected up a 40 degree inclined plane with an initial KE
of 16J, and it travels 0.6 m before compressing a 200 N/m spring 0.2 m,
what is its KE? The student defines variables, draws a body and axes, enters
givens, then writes "d=.2m."&nbsp; However, d is defined as the displacement
from T0 to T1, which is .8 m.&nbsp; On the other hand, 0.2m = d1, where
d1 is the student's variable for the compression of the spring at T0.
<ul>
<li>
IH sees only "d1 = 0.2m" as the closest matching equation.&nbsp; She asks,
"What is 0.2m?" then asks what variable corresponds to that quantity.</li>

<li>
RO sees only d=.8m, so he asks "what is d again?" then points out that
the displacement must be at least 0.6.</li>

<li>
Andes also addresses definition of variables and agrees with RO on student's
intended equation ("d = 0.8m")</li>

<li>
KVL: Both the d=.8 and d1=.2 interpretations are plausible, and both equations
are part of the solution.&nbsp; It doesn't matter which one Andes gives
hints on.</li>
</ul>
If the value of d is given in the problem representation instead of computed
by adding, then this bug can analyze the error.&nbsp; I'm not sure how
to find the other interpretation, because it is not a simple time specifier
confusion despite the names that the student gave the varibles.&nbsp; At
any rate, this bug should remedy the student's slip.

<a NAME="Kiesel 18-55"></a>Kiesel Eq-USNA 18-55 first equation</h3>
In the problem where a hailstone is falling to the ground from the sky,
the student defines variables, draws a body and standard axes, then enters
“d_y=9000m,” some other givens and “d=0+v0_y*t+(1/2)a_y*t^2.”&nbsp; Both
equations are red.&nbsp; The first one should be d_y=-9000m (the student
dropped the negative sign), but that is discussed elsewhere.&nbsp; The
second one should have d_y instead of d on the left side, or alternatively,
should have a minus sign on the left.&nbsp; Either way, the resulting equation
is an inefficient one to use for this problem.&nbsp; The tutors gave advice
on the second equation, but Andes gave advice on the first equation.
<ul>
<li>
IH didn’t notice the error.&nbsp; Instead, she wants the student to use
“v1_y^2 = v0_y^2 + 2*a_y*d_y”&nbsp; She points out that the question asks
the student to find ‘v’ not ‘d’ and questions the student’s method for
finding ‘v’ with the equation entered.</li>

<li>
RO notes “d_y = 0 + v0_y*t + 0.5*a_y*t^2” as student’s intended equation
and addresses the sign (direction) of motion.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Make sure you are using the correct signs in this equation.”</li>

<li>
KVL: In Andes2, the displacement vector would have to be drawn before the
equation can be written, so this equation is not premature.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the problem specification to the KB treats d_y=-9000m as a given rather
than the result of a projection operation.&nbsp; Thus, there is no hint
sequence on the operator application.&nbsp; Thus, Andes must treat this
error as a slip.</li>

<li>
KVL: For help on the second equation (assuming all variables are defined
by drawing vectors) Andes should say, “Your equation is similar to one
I know, but it is not part of an efficient solution to the problem.&nbsp;
You may click here for help on fixing your equation or here for help on
finding a more efficient solution.”&nbsp; If the student wants help on
fixing the equation, then Andes ought to say, “Although most of your components
are expressed as variables, one is not.&nbsp; Try rewriting the equation
will all the components expressed as variables.”</li>
</ul>

<li>
The bug yields a correct, primitive, non-premature equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The slip-based analysis is not ideal here, but one that checks for projection
problems is too much work.&nbsp; If the student is confused about projections,
it will also come out in other contexts.</li>
