At time T0, a firecracker is hurled with given initial velocity at a 60
degree angle.&nbsp; How high is it when it explodes 2 seconds later?&nbsp;
The student drew a body and initial velocity, then defined a variable for
the acceleration at time T0.&nbsp; The problem actually involves the average
acceleration over T0 to T1, which is the same as a_y which is the same
as g.
<p>Andes matches the student entry to acceleration over the T0 to T1 (one
mismatch: time).&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator application is efficient and
not premature.&nbsp; Andes runs the preamble up to the projectile PSM then
hints/teaches/states that "When apply the projectile motion method, the
acceleration should be defined over the same time interval as the method."

On the bullet-gong problem, the student defined the bullet as the body
at time T0. It should be defined over the time interval T0 to T1.&nbsp;
This is best handled with a preamble, because the student has to see that
the plan is to apply kinematics over the time interval, and that is why
the body is defined over the time interval. (That would also take care
of a second problem that this student has, which is that she has defined
a variable for the speed of sound over T0 to T1, and that variable is unnecessary.
I don't know why Andes 1 marked that variable correct.)
<p>Andes matches the student's entry to the op ap that draws a body over
the time interval T0 to T1 (one mismatch: time).&nbsp; The op ap is efficient
and not premature.&nbsp; The hint associated with it runs the preamble,
which is a bit lengthy, namely:&nbsp; Andes asks for the sought (distance
to target) and the method (speed-distance-duration).&nbsp; However, when
Andes asks for the body and time of the method, the student can go either
for bullet during T0 to T1 or sound during T1 to T2.&nbsp; Hopefully, the
student chooses the bullet, because then Andes can fire the hint sequence
above about drawing the body for the whole time interval.&nbsp; If the
student chooses the sound instead, then that hint sequence will never get
a chance to apply, because the student will have to draw the other body
first.&nbsp; Thus, the hint sequence in this case should just say to run
next-step help, period.

A 90 kg parachutist jumps from a plane at T0, hits the snow at 20 m/s at
T1, and comes to rest at T2 at the bottom of a 1 m crater.&nbsp; What average
net force acted on him as he made the crater?&nbsp; The student's first
action is to define a variable for the duration from T0 to T1.&nbsp; This
is not needed, as kinematics can be applied to T1 to T2 directly, because
the velocity at T1 is given.&nbsp; The right pedagogy is to give Next-step
help up to the point where kinematics over T1 to T2 is selected as the
PSM, then point out that the duration should defined to have the same time
interval.

A 90 kg parachutist jumps from a plane at T0, hits the snow at T1 at 20
m/s and stops at the bottom of a 1 m deep crater at T2.&nbsp; What is the
average net force that acted on him as he plowed into the snow?&nbsp; The
student drew a correct acceleration for T1 to T2, initial velocity at T1,
and a downward non-zero net force vector for time T2.&nbsp; The net force
is non-zero and upward before T2 and zero afterwards, but it is not clear
what it is right at T2.&nbsp; However, the student doesn't need the net
force at this time point. If they need it at all, it is during the time
intervale T1 to T2.

How long did it take the Blackbird to cover 1000 km at an average speed
of 935 m/s?&nbsp; The student solved the problem correctly, but drew a
body for T0, the starting time instead of the time interval&nbsp; T0 to
T1 (one mismatch: time).
<p>Normally, selecting a wrong time for a body would be handled by giving
the preamble, but the student has already completed the PSM in this case
so giving the preamble first doesn't make sense.&nbsp; This student apparently
thinks of the body tool as just drawing a dot, and doesn't realize that
it should also match the time interval for the PSM.
