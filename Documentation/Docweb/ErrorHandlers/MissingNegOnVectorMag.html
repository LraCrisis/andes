<p>If the student entry is an equation

<li>
that contains (mag ?vector)</li>

<li>
(hint string (teach) "You seem to be confusing the magnitude of ~a with

<a NAME="Paul-Oyler 55-17"></a>Paul-Oyler Eq-USNA 55-17</h3>
In the problem of the jumping kangaroo, the student draws a diagram with
initial velocity and acceleration, defines variables, and enters “d = v0(t)
+ 1/2(a)t^2” as the first equation.&nbsp; The closest matching equation
has –a instead of a.&nbsp; This equation is both premature (vectors and
the component equation should be entered first) and inefficient.
<ul>
<li>
IH fails to notice the sign error.&nbsp; She coaches the student through
solving the problem with the student’s equation, the points out that&nbsp;
“v1_y^2 = v0_y^2 - 2*a*d = 0” is more efficient.</li>

<li>
RO sees the sign error, and asks the student for the direction of acceleration.</li>

<li>
Andes says to check signs.</li>
</ul>
The bug by itself suffices to make the equation correct.&nbsp; Indy analysis
finds that the correct equation corresponds to d_y=v0_y*t+0.5*a_y*t^2,&nbsp;
d_y=d,&nbsp; v0_y=v0,&nbsp; a_y=–a.&nbsp; SG analysis shows that it is
premature, since the displacement vector needs to be written first.&nbsp;
It also discovers that this path is less efficient than one that uses vf_y^2=vi_y^2
+ 2*a_y*d_y.&nbsp; But that equation is also premature, as it requires
the displacement vector to be drawn.&nbsp; Thus, Andes decides to suggest
drawing that vector, as it would be the right thing to say in either case.
<p>Suppose the student draws the displacement vector then asks again why
their equation is red.&nbsp; The error diagnosis and Indy analysis are
the same, but the SG analysis indicates that hinting the target equation
will take the student down an inefficient path.&nbsp; Andes should say,
“Your equation is similar to one I know, but it is not part of an efficient
solution to the problem.&nbsp; You may click here for help on fixing your
equation or here for help on finding a more efficient solution.”&nbsp;
If the student wants help on fixing the equation, then since acceleration
is drawn, the student should first enter the equation in component form.
<p>Suppose the student now enters their kinematics equation in component
form, d_y = v0_y(t) + 1/2(a_y)t^2.&nbsp; This is correct, so the student
reenters the original equation, which turns red, and the student asks for
help again.&nbsp; The equation is no longer premature, so Andes gives the
bug's hint sequence.

<a NAME="Kiesel 18-55"></a>Kiesel Eq-USNA 18-55 second equation</h3>
In the problem where a hailstone is falling to the ground from the sky,
the student defines variables, draws a body and standard axes, then enters
“d_y=9000m,” some other givens and “d=0+v0_y*t+(1/2)a_y*t^2.”&nbsp; Both
equations are red.&nbsp; The first one should be d_y=-9000m (the student
dropped the negative sign), but that is discussed elsewhere.&nbsp; The
second one should have d_y instead of d on the left side, or alternatively,
should have a minus sign on the left.&nbsp; Either way, the resulting equation
is an inefficient one to use for this problem.&nbsp; The tutors gave advice
on the second equation, but Andes gave advice on the first equation.
<ul>
<li>
IH didn’t notice the error.&nbsp; Instead, she wants the student to use
“v1_y^2 = v0_y^2 + 2*a_y*d_y”&nbsp; She points out that the question asks
the student to find ‘v’ not ‘d’ and questions the student’s method for
finding ‘v’ with the equation entered.</li>

<li>
RO notes “d_y = 0 + v0_y*t + 0.5*a_y*t^2” as student’s intended equation
and addresses the sign (direction) of motion.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Make sure you are using the correct signs in this equation.”</li>

<li>
KVL: In Andes2, the displacement vector would have to be drawn before the
equation can be written, so this equation is not premature.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the problem specification to the KB treats d_y=-9000m as a given rather
than the result of a projection operation.&nbsp; Thus, there is no hint
sequence on the operator application.&nbsp; Thus, Andes must treat this
error as a slip.</li>

<li>
KVL: For help on the second equation (assuming all variables are defined
by drawing vectors) Andes should say, “Your equation is similar to one
I know, but it is not part of an efficient solution to the problem.&nbsp;
You may click here for help on fixing your equation or here for help on
finding a more efficient solution.”&nbsp; If the student wants help on
fixing the equation, then Andes ought to say, “Although most of your components
are expressed as variables, one is not.&nbsp; Try rewriting the equation
will all the components expressed as variables.”</li>
</ul>
For the second equation, the bug yields a correct, primitive, non-premature
but inefficient equation.&nbsp; Andes asks the fix-or-replace question.&nbsp;
If the student elects to fix this equation, the bug's hint sequence applies.

<a NAME="rat 49-48"></a>rat Eq-USNA 49-48</h3>
In the problem where the aircraft carrier plows into a pier, the student
defines variables, draws a body, an axis and the initial velocity, enters
some equations, then enters “a = a_x.”&nbsp; The target equation has –a
for a..
<ul>
<li>
IH asks what would happen to the final velocity if a_x>0.</li>

<li>
RO asks “what is the direction of a?”.</li>

<li>
Andes also notes sign error.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should ask the student to draw the acceleration vector.</li>
</ul>
The bug yields a correct, primitive but premature equation.&nbsp; Suppose
the student draws vectors and gets the acceleration direction right (perhaps
with some coaching), then asks again why this equation is wrong.&nbsp;
Same interpretation.&nbsp; Bug's hint sequence is given.&nbsp; The teaching
hint is not great here, because it starts out by claiming the student is
confusing the magnitude with the component.&nbsp; This is not true in this
case, as the student has just entered the projection equation.&nbsp; Could
have a separate bug for this case if it comes up enough.
<h3>
ronjon21 Eq-USNA 31-18</h3>
In the problem where the aircraft carrier plows into a pier, the student
defined variables, drew a FBD without acceleration, then entered "vf_x
= v_x + a*t" as the first equation.&nbsp; The target equation has -a instead
of a or a_x instead of a.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes a sign error and questions the direction of 'a_x' and has student
explain what is happening physically with the equation the student entered.</li>

<li>
RO asks, "what is the direction of a_x?"</li>

<li>
Andes suggestions checking signs.</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp; Andes should say, “You can prevent errors like this by always
drawing acceleration and other relevant vectors on the FBD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the student asks it to explain further, it can say, “Please draw the
acceleration.”</li>
</ul>
Substituting a_x for a creates a correct, primitive equation that is premature.&nbsp;
Andes should ask the student to draw the acceleration.&nbsp; If the student
asks for what's wrong help again, Andes will suggest writing the compo
version of kinematics.&nbsp; If that doesn't cause the student to fix the
equation, then it runs the bug's hint sequence.
<h3>
bee Eq-USNA 8-29</h3>
In the problem where a person is hanging onto a rope over a cliff, the
student defines variables, draws axes and a body but no forces or acceleration,
then enters "Fw_y = F + Fn" where Fw is weight, F is friction and Fn is
the net force.&nbsp; The target equation has -Fn for Fn.
<ul>
<li>
IH has student draw forces, then write projections, then rewrite the target
equation.</li>

<li>
RO has student draw forces including the net force, then asks about direction
of Fn, then rewrite the target equation.</li>

<li>
Andes says to check signs.</li>
</ul>
This demonstrates that the bug should apply with net forces as well a individual
forces.&nbsp; In this case, the bug yields a compound, premature equation,
so Andes says to draw a fbd first.
<h3>
LoseBerry Eq-USNA 9-24</h3>
In the problem where a car is rolling down a driveway towards a garage
door, the student defines variables, draws an FBD without weight, enters
equations, then enters “vf^2 = vi^2 + 2*ag_x*(dc).”&nbsp; The closest matching
equation has –dc instead of dc.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes a sign error and questions definition of dc(_x) and notes equation:
“vf_x^2 = vi_x^2 + 2*a*g_x*dc_x”.</li>

<li>
RO also notes sign error and also questions definition of dc_x and points
out same equation that IH pointed out.</li>

<li>
Andes also notes sign error.</li>

<li>
KVL: Since dc is drawn, Andes should say, “Try writing the equation in
textbook, component form (i.e., no magnitudes; use only variables for components
instead).”</li>
</ul>
The bug yields an equation that is compound and premature, so Andes says
to finish drawing the fbd first, then it suggests writing the equation
in component form.
<h3>
lewiston Eq-USNA 10-23</h3>
In the problem of the supertanker, the student defines variables, draws
a body and axes, then enters “d=(vti*t)+(.5*a*t^2).”&nbsp; The target equation
has –a instead of a.
<ul>
<li>
IH asks the student to draw the acceleration.</li>

<li>
RO asks for the direction of ‘a’.</li>

<li>
Andes also notes the sign error</li>
</ul>
Andes should ask the student to draw the acceleration.
