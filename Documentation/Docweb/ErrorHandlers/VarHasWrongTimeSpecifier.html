<p>If the student entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that contains a quantity with a time specifier ?time-student</li>

<li>
and replacing it with ?time-correct makes the equation correct</li>
</ul>
then run the hint sequence
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "Check the times used in the definition of ~a." student's
var that contains ?time-student)</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) "You defined t to be the duration of T1 to T2,
but your equation should have the duration of T0 to T2."&nbsp; then "Redefine
t to be the duration of T0 to T2.") This is instantiated for the error
below just ot make it easier to read.</li>
</ul>

023300 Eq-USNA 22-52</h3>
In the problem where a bullet is fired and hits a gong, the student defined
variables, drew a body and axes, defined t as the duration from T1 to T2,
then entered "t = 0.731" where 0.731 is the given value for the duration
from T0 to T2.&nbsp; The student has not defined a variable for the duration
from T0 to T2.
<ul>
<li>
IH asks for definition of t, then points out that 0.731 is for a different
time interval.</li>

<li>
RO asks for definition of t, then points out that 0.731 is for a different
time interval.</li>

<li>
Andes1 just questions value of 't' that the student entered. The correct
equation that Andes identifies is 't = 0.606s", which is the correct value
for t, but it would take lots of calculation to derive it.</li>

<li>
KVL: The problem says, "...and hears the sound .731 seconds later" which
is linguistically ambigous between T0 to T2 and T1 to T2.&nbsp; However,
thinking about how the shooter would measure the elapsed time suggests
that he would find it more convenient to start the timer when he fires
the gun rather than when he sees the little tiny bullet strike the target
a long ways away.&nbsp; Thus, "experimenters' common sense" suggests the
T0 to T2 interpretation.&nbsp; None of this reasoning is particularly relevant
to physics, so the problem should be changed to remove this ambiguity (msg
sent to Anders 3/22/01).&nbsp; In the meantime, we can treat this as a
slip, because there is certainly no reason to teach the operator applicatino
that writes this given.</li>
</ul>
Andes tries substituting various correct durations for t until it finds
that t02 makes the equation correct.&nbsp; Indy analysis finds that t02=0.731
is primitive, and SG analysis says that it is not premature.&nbsp; The
operator application for writing the given has no hint sequence, so Andes
must treat this as a slip.&nbsp; The hint sequence is, "Check the times
used in the definition of t." then "You defined t to be the duration of
T1 to T2, but your equation should have the duration of T0 to T2."&nbsp;
then "Redefine t to be the duration of T0 to T2."

<a NAME="chris 43-39"></a>Chris Eq-USNA 43-39</h3>
In the problem of a block on a spring, the student defines variables, draws
a body, and enters "U0 = mbgh."&nbsp; The target equations are U0=mb*g*(-d)
where d is compression of the spring, or U2 = mb*g*h where h is the height
of the block at its apex.&nbsp; U0 and U2 are the PE at times T0 and T2,
respectively.&nbsp; Thus, the student has either used U0 instead of U2
or has use h instead of –d.
<ul>
<li>
IH complains about the use of implicit multiplication, then points out
that at T0, the block will be lower than the zero point of gravitational
PE.</li>

<li>
RO says, "U0 is the PE at T0.&nbsp; h is the height of the block at T2."</li>

<li>
Andes suggests using PE at T2 rather than PE at T0.</li>

<li>
KVL: The justifications for these two equations are nearly the same—only
the time points differ.&nbsp; Thus, asking for a justification may not
disambiguate these two.</li>
</ul>
Andes can find the second interpretation by replacing the students U0 with
U2, which yields a correct, primitive, non-premature equation that Andes
should hint.&nbsp; It can't find the other interpretation, but even if
it could, it would reject it because it is a compound equation, and thus
less likely.
