<h2>
Unanalyzable equation errors</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/21/01)</center>

<p>The main issue here is whether to ask students to describe in English
or menus what equation they were trying to enter.&nbsp; The data below
suggests that this is not necessary.&nbsp; If Andes just gives next-step
help when it can't interpret an equation, the advice seems to be pertinent
and pedagogically useful.
<h3>
wacker Eq-USNA 5-46-37</h3>
In the problem with the model airplane hanging from two strings, the student
defines variables, draws a correct FBD,&nbsp; then enters “1.414Ft1+.5Ft2=-Fw”
as the first equation.&nbsp; The target equation is sin(135)*Ft1+sin(60)*Ft2=-Fw.&nbsp;
The student has written (1/sin(135))*Ft1 + cos(60)*Ft2 = -Fw.&nbsp; That
is, the student has used 1/sin(135) instead of sin(135) and cos(60) instead
of sin(60).
<ul>
<li>
IH notices that there is a trigonometry error with the student’s equation
and points out sine/cosine properties to student using a triangle.</li>

<li>
RO also notices trig error, and also refreshes student on trig.</li>

<li>
Andes fails to recognize the equation the student was trying to enter.</li>

<li>
KVL: The student should first write N1L with components.</li>
</ul>
Andes could interpret the error if the student hadn't inverted the sin(135).&nbsp;
But I think the search would generate too many false positives if we included
arbitrary inversions among the equation perturbations.&nbsp; So let's assume
that Andes2 cannot interpret this equation.&nbsp; It thus must give next-step
help.&nbsp; Andes asks for the sought (a string tension), the method (Newtons'
law applied to the plane), and then looks to see what goals the student
has accomplished already.&nbsp; It finds that the FBD has been done, so
it says, "You have already drawn the FBD, which is good, so your next step
should be to write Newton's law in terms of the force component variables."&nbsp;
This is just what Andes would have suggested even if we had been able to
interpret the error.
<h3>
Exscientia Eq-USNA 17-28</h3>
If a roller coaster car goes through a loop-de-loop which has a radius
of 20.0 m, and the normal force is equal to the weight at thetop of the
loop, how fast is the car travelling?&nbsp; The student defines accleration,
velocity and radius variables, draws a correct FBD with forces only, enters
many equations (many seem to be copies of Andes’ help), then enters “v=v_y/20”
where 20 is the radius of the loop.
<ul>
<li>
IH thnks that “v=v_y” is intended equation, so she addresses dimensionality
and suggests using the student’s equations 4 &amp; 5 (“a_y * mcar – Fn_y
– Fw_y =0” &amp; “v^2 = r*a” respectively) to yield ‘a’ &amp; ‘v’.</li>

<li>
RO questions where the incorrect equation comes from questioning the previously
entered equation number 8 (‘a = v^2/20”)</li>

<li>
Andes gives a different equation (“20 = 0.05102 * v^2) and explains that
Andes does not have a value for ‘v_y’</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp;&nbsp; I can’t figure out what the target equation is.&nbsp;
I’d give this person “what next” help.</li>
</ul>
Andes2 shuldn't be able to interpret this error, so it will give next step
help.&nbsp; It asks for the sought (velocity), the method (a=v/r^2), and
notes that this PSM has been applied already (student's equation 5).&nbsp;
It asks for the next sought (acceleration), the method (Newton's law),
and notes that it is only partially complete (compo eqn is eqn 4 and 5;
acceleration projection is contained in eqn 6; no projection equations
yet for normal force and weight).&nbsp; It suggests, "You have finished
the FBD and written NSL in terms of component variables (your equations
4 and 5).&nbsp; The next step is to write projection equations for each
of the vector components.&nbsp; You've done one (acceleration).&nbsp; You
need to do the others.&nbsp; For instance, you need to write the projection
equations for normal force."&nbsp; This is actually pretty good advice
under the circumstances.
<h3>
m021788 Eq-USNA 22-59</h3>
In the problem where the aircraft carrier plows into the pier, after defining
variables and drawing a FBD, the subject entered “Ff = 1.386E9*t*30”
<ul>
<li>
IH notices that student does not apply Newton’s 3rd Law correctly and the
critique focuses on action-reaction</li>

<li>
RO seems to follow the same method as IH</li>

<li>
Andes fails to recognize the equation the student was trying to enter.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should give next-step help.</li>
</ul>
Andes2 won't be able to interpret this error, so it will give next step
help.&nbsp; It asks for the sought (contact force on the pier due to the
carrier) then method (Newton's third law).&nbsp; The student has drawn
the net force on the pier and the net force on the carrier.&nbsp; Now the
third law cannot be applied to net forces, but the student has not drawn
the appropriate contact forces.&nbsp; Thus, the first step in the NTL procedure
is to draw those forces.&nbsp; Andes says, "The first step in applying
Newton's third law is to draw the pair of forces that are involved.&nbsp;
Try that."&nbsp; If the student clicks on explain-further, Andes should
say, "Try drawing the force that the pier exerts on the carrier."&nbsp;
This seems like pretty good advice under the circumstances.
<h3>
m021788 Eq-USNA 23-59</h3>
The student replaced the equation written a minute ago (see above) with&nbsp;
“F=1.386E9” where F is the net force on the aircraft carrier.&nbsp; The
target equation is the one written immediately before this one, F=4.630E7.&nbsp;
The ratio of these two values is 51.5.
<ul>
<li>
IH notices that student does not apply Newton’s 3rd Law correctly and the
critique focuses on units to show the subject why the equation is wrong.</li>

<li>
RO agrees that the student does not apply Newton’s 3rd Law correctly, but
in the critique focuses more on action-reaction to explain what’s wrong
with the student’s equation.</li>

<li>
Andes fails to recognize the equation the student was trying to enter.</li>

<li>
KVL: The student is probably trying to figure out the sought, which is
the “average force it would exert in the process.”&nbsp; The student might
be picking up on the word “average” and trying to divide or multiply by
the duration (30) but somehow got the arithmetic wrong.&nbsp; It's just
not clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andes should give next-step help here.</li>
</ul>
Andes2 will treat this error just like the one above.
<h3>
juicemasta Eq-USNA 23-20</h3>
In the problem where the aircraft carrier plows into the pier, after defining
variables and drawing a FBD, the student entered "F=v*t" where v is the
initial velocity and t is the duration.
<ul>
<li>
IH thinks student is lost.&nbsp; Has student check dimensions of F=v*t,
then asks for N2L.</li>

<li>
RO thinks student is lost.&nbsp; Has student check dimensions of F=v*t,
then asks for N3L, then acceleration, then final equation.</li>

<li>
Andes suggests an unknown equation with no explanation for suggestion.</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp; Andes should give next step help.</li>
</ul>
Andes2 won't be able to interpret this equation, so it will give next step
help. It asks for the sought (contact force on the pier due to the carrier)
and the method (Newton's third law).&nbsp; It notes that neither contact
force is drawn and suggests drawing them. This seems like pretty good advice
under the circumstances.
<h3>
freebird Eq-USNA 1-44-15</h3>
In the problem where the model airplane is hanging from two strings, the
student defines variables, draws a correct FBD, enters givens, then enters
“Ft1 / cos(45) = Fw.” as the first non-trivial equation.&nbsp; The target
equation is Ft1*sin(45) + Ft2*sin(60) = Fw.&nbsp; The student has left
a force component out and has projected Ft1 incorrectly.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes that student does not include all of the forces and that there
is a trig. error, then gives a trig. refresher.</li>

<li>
RO also notes that student does not include all of the forces and notes
“Fw = Ft1*sin(45) + Ft2*sin(60)”</li>

<li>
Andes comes up with a different equation “Fw = 1.932*Ft1” with no explanation.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should say, "Skipping steps has caused some errors here.&nbsp;
I assume you are applying N1L to the airplane.&nbsp; If so, your next step
should be to write N1L in component form.”</li>
</ul>
This is probably too hard for Andes2 to diagnose.&nbsp; It should just
give next-step help.
<h3>
minivan Eq-USNA 32-21</h3>
In the problem of a car accelerating from 13.4 m/s to 17.9 m/s, the student
defines variables, draws no FBD, enters givens, then enters “a = (v3)/t1”
The closest matching equation is a = (v3-v)/(t1-t0).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The student has both used a time point t1 as a variable and has treated
the initial velocity, v, as zero.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes that student overlooks the fact that the car does not begin at
rest (at T2) and addresses defining/clarifying velocities and time points.</li>

<li>
RO asks for the definition of acceleration as a= (vf –vi)/(tf-ti) then
works toward the student’s equation.</li>

<li>
Andes addresses the two definitions of ‘a’ (student had also entered “a
= 2.732”) and also notes that T1 was marked as incorrect earlier (although
it doesn’t show up in the snapshot) and suggests “-a * DURATION8 = v -
v3”.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should tell the student to draw the diagram before entering
equations.</li>
</ul>
Andes2 won't be able to interpret this error, so it will given next-step
help.&nbsp; It will asks for the sought (duration from T2 to T3) and the
method (kinematics from T2 to T3).&nbsp; It will note that the FBD has
not been drawn, and ask the student to do that.&nbsp; Suppose the student
does so then asks for help again on the same equation.&nbsp; Now Andes
again can't find an interpretation, so it again gives next-step help.&nbsp;
This time, it notes that the kinematics diagram for T2 to T3 is drawn,
so it suggest writing the equation in terms of vector components.&nbsp;
This is actually good advice under the circumstances, as that was the equation
that the student was trying to write, I think.
