<h2>
At rest means zero velocity</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/27/01)</center>

<p>Most student's know that when an object is at rest, its velocity is
zero.&nbsp; Thus, errors are usually due to not knowing how to draw zero-length
vectors or not reading the problem statement carefully enough.
<p>If the student's entry is a velocity vector
<ul>
<li>
that is non-zero length</li>

<li>
and making it zero length yields a correct entry</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
Ask the student model if the student knows how to draw zero-length vectors:</li>

<ul>
<li>
if a training card on how to draw zero-length vectors has not yet been
given, then give it.</li>

<li>
else if the student has not yet drawn 2 zero-length vectors without help,
then give a hint string reminder "If you want to draw zero-length vector,
just double click instead of dragging out an arrow."</li>

<li>
else the student ahs drawn 2 more more zero-length vectors so they know
how to do it.</li>
</ul>

<li>
hint/teach/state that whenever a problem doesn't state a velocity at a
certain time, but it is reasonable to assume that the object is at rest,
then assume that it is at rest.</li>
</ul>

A hailstone falls 9000 meters.&nbsp; What speed does it strike the ground,
ignoring air friction?&nbsp; The student draws a non-zero vector for initial
velocity, when the vector should have zero length.&nbsp; (The Katina &amp;
LoseBerry errors occur on different problelms, but the analysis is the
same)&nbsp; The interpretation is the initial-velocity operator application
(one mismatch: magnitude), and it is not premature and on an efficient
solution path.&nbsp; So Andes must decide whether the error is due to a
slip, user interface ignorance or weak physics knowledge.&nbsp; As discussed
above, slips are unlikely for zero/non-zero vector errors, but the student
could easily be lacking user interface knowledge.
<p>Suppose the student has already drawn zero-length vectors several times,
which suggests that they are not a victim of user interface ignorance.&nbsp;
The actual problem statement does not say that the hailstone was initially
at rest, nor does it give an initial velocity.&nbsp; The student has probably
failed to infer that the hailstone is initially at rest.
