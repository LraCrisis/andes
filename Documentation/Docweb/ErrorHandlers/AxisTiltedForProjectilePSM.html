Axis tilted for projectile PSM</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/27/01)</center>
If the student's entry is an axis
<ul>
<li>
that does not have a zero rotation</li>

<li>
and making it have zero rotation makes it correct</li>

<li>
and the axis is part of a projectile motion PSM</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
run the preamble up to the projectile PSM</li>

<li>
hint/teach/state that whenever one is using the PSM method, the axes should
be in standard (zero) rotation.</li>
</ul>

How high does a firecracker go when it is hurled at a speed of 20 m/s at
an angle of 60 degrees?&nbsp; The student defined variables for initial
velocity, duration and displacement, then drew coordinate axes tilted 60
degrees.&nbsp; The student's basic approach should be to apply kinematics
along the vertical axis, not a tilted one.&nbsp; Andes should go through
the preamble up to the point where the PSM has been completely identified,
then give a hint sequence.
<p>Andes matches the student's entry to the standard axes (one mismatch:
rotation).&nbsp; The op ap is efficient and not premature (here I'm assuming
that the student draws the velocity and displacement instead of defining
variables for them).&nbsp; It's not likely to be a slip or user interface
ignorance.&nbsp; The hint sequence should to do the preamble up to the
projectile PSM, then hint/teach/state that whenever one is applying the
projectile motion method, the axes should be in standard orientation.
