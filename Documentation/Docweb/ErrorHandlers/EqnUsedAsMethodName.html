Equations used as method names</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/27/01)</center>

<p>Students sometimes use equations such as F=ma, W=mg, U=mgh, etc. as
names for methods.&nbsp; Usually this just causes undefined variable or
illegal syntax errors (implicit multiplication is illegal, so F=ma won't
parse right but F=m*a will).&nbsp; However, sometimes the student has all
the variables defined, in which case we need a bug to detect what the student
is trying to do.&nbsp; Basically, we need one bug per equation, but we
can add them as we see them.&nbsp; Here's the bug for F=m*a:
<p>If the student entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that has the form &lt;force> = &lt;mass>*&lt;acceleration> or &lt;mass>*&lt;acceleration>=&lt;force>
where the vector quantities are either magnitudes or components, and &lt;force>
can be either the net force or any individual force,</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
a trainning card hint: "Are you writing F=m*a just to show that you intend
to apply Newton's law?&nbsp; Newton's law is indeed the right approach
to solving this problem.&nbsp; However, Andes interprets all your equations
as specific statements about the problem.&nbsp; In particular, it interprets
"f=m*a" in terms of the variables f, m and a that you have defined for
this problem.&nbsp; In this case, the definitions of at least one of those
variables makes this equation inappropriate for the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you just want to provide an explanation to the reader, then put a semi-colon
(;) before it.&nbsp; Andes ignores everything in the box after the semi-colon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For instance, if you want to say that you were going to apply Newton's
law, then you could just but "; F=ma" in the equation box (without the
double quotes, of course.).&nbsp; This will stay black instead of turning
red or green, because Andes doesn't read anything after the semi-colon.&nbsp;
However, whoever reads the printed copy of your work will see it and know
that your subsequent equations will be an application of Newton's law."</li>
</ul>
A KCD version of this would treat the first question "Are you writing F=m*a
just to show that you intend to apply Newton's law?" as a real question.
<h3>
minivan Eq-USNA 28-29</h3>
If a person of known mass is hanging from a bridge by a bungee cord, what
is the tension in the cord?&nbsp; The student defined f, m and a variables
(no FBD, though) then entered “f=m*a” as the first equation, where f is
defined as the <i>tension</i> force, not the net force.
<ul>
<li>
IH first points out the discrepancy between tension force and net force,
then asks if a has any particular value in this problem.</li>

<li>
RO doesn’t identify a correct equation but questions ‘f’ and asks for a
FBD.</li>

<li>
Andes1 says, “Maybe you should multiply by ‘G’ rather than by ‘a’ in the
right side of the equation.”</li>

<li>
KVL: Since this is a first-law problem, the &lt;net-force>=m*a equation
is not needed, and it is unlikely that she solved the whole problem in
her head and was trying the write f=m*g, which is the answer. The student
is probably using "f=m*a" as a name for Newton's law, rather than a real
equation.&nbsp; Students are often taught to provide such comments as part
of their homework solutions.&nbsp; The best advice is probably to address
this misunderstanding of how to use equations in the equation window.</li>
</ul>
Andes could find analyses for this equation by substituting the net force
for f or by substituting g for a.&nbsp; That would lead to advice similar
to IH/RO and Andes1.&nbsp; However, let's use this error handler: "If the
student's entry is literally 'f=m*a' or 'm*a=f', and the solution uses
Newton's first or second law, then say, 'Are you writing F=m*a just to
show that you intend to apply Newton's law?&nbsp; Newton's law is indeed
the right approach to solving this problem.&nbsp; However, Andes interprets
all your equations as specific statements about the problem.&nbsp; In particular,
it interprets "f=m*a" in terms of the variables f, m and a that you have
defined for this problem.&nbsp; In this case, the definitions of at least
one of those variables makes this equation inappropriate for the problem.&nbsp;
If you just want to provide an explanation to the reader, then put a semi-colon
(;) before it.&nbsp; Andes ignores everything in the box after the semi-colon."&nbsp;
This should be conveyed with a training card instead of a hint.
