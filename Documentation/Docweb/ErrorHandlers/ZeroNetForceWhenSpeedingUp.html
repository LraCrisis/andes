<h2>
Zero net force when speeding up</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/27/01)</center>

<p>If the student entry is a net force
<ul>
<li>
that has zero magnitude</li>

<li>
and the body's motion is straight and speeding up in direction ?dir</li>

<li>
and making the net force non-zero in direction ?dir yields a correct vector</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "Is the net force zero even though the body is moving
in a straight line and speeding up?")</li>

<li>
(hint string (teach) "Whenever a body is moving in a straight line and
speeding up, it is accelerating.&nbsp; Whenever a body is accelerating,
there is a net force acting on it in the same direction as the acceleration.&nbsp;
This follows directly from Newton's second law, F=m*a.")</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) "Because the body is speeding up in direction
~a, it is accelerating in direction ~a, so you should change the net force
so that it is non-zero and in direction ~a." ?dir ?dir ?dir)</li>
</ul>
The hints must be worded so that they make sense even if the student has
drawn the acceleration correctly or incorrectly.
<p>A KCD version of the teaching hint would go like this one:&nbsp; "Is
?body moving in a straight line and speeding up at ?time?" (Ideal Student
Answer: Yes) "Does ?body have a non-zero acceleration? (Ideal Student Answer:
Yes)&nbsp; "If a body has a non-zero acceleration, is the net force on
it zero or non-zero?"&nbsp; (Ideal student answer: zero) "But you have
drawn a zero-length net force vector.&nbsp; You should change that."
<p>Clearly, we need similar bugs for the the slowing down case and for
the circular motion case.&nbsp; We also need similar handlers for errors
where the student has drawn a zero <i>acceleration</i> in for an object
that is speeding up, slowing down or moving in a circle.

A car starts from rest at T0 and rolls down a frictionless 20 m driveway,
smashing into the garage door at T1.&nbsp; The student draws a zero-length
net force on the car, but the actual net force is non-zero.&nbsp; Andes2
interprets the error as an attempt to draw the non-zero net force (one
mismatch: magnitude).&nbsp; SG analysis indicates that the operator application
is not premature and not efficient.&nbsp; However, it is not an inefficiency
that Andes should point out (see <a href="../DesignDiscussion/IntermediateTerms.html">discussion</a>),
basically because it is more important to get the physics right than to
learn the most efficient procedure.
