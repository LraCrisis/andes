<h2>
Unnecessary units conversions</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/27/01)</center>

<p>Some problems express given quantities in non-standard units, but Andes
variables are always in terms of MKS units.&nbsp; The student should thus
convert the values when entering the equation that assigns a value to that
variable (e.g., if the problem says that the distance is 29 km, then the
student should write d=29000 m to assign a value to the distance variable
d.)&nbsp; However, students sometimes assume that the variable are in terms
of the given units, and thus put the conversion factors into the equations.&nbsp;
Detecting these kinds of bugs means that the existance of non-MKS units
in the problem statment must be included in the problem description in
the KB.
<p>If the student entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
and the problem givens include non-MKS units for ?quantity</li>

<li>
and the conversion factor for ?quantity to put it into MKS units is ?conversion</li>

<li>
and ?conversion appears in the student's equation anywhere</li>

<li>
and removing it creates a correct equation</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
a training card that says, "It seems that you put a units conversion factor
in your equation because &lt;quantity> was specified in &lt;problem units>
but the MKS units are &lt;equivalent units>.&nbsp; However, Andes assumes
that variables are defined in terms of MKS units.&nbsp; Thus, you should
do the conversion when assigning a value to the variable, but leave the
conversion factors out of all the other equations that use that variable.&nbsp;
For instance, suppose the problem says that a certain distance is 29 km.&nbsp;
You define the variable D for it.&nbsp; Then you should write "D = 29000
m."&nbsp; If you later use D in an equation, such as the speed-distance-duration
equation, then you would use it without the conversion factor e.g., S=D/T.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do NOT put S=(D*1000)/T. "</li>
</ul>

<h3>
M024446 Eq-USNA 14-53</h3>
In the problem where the Blackbird plane sets a speed record, after defining
variables (FBD has a mass but no forces), the student entered “t=(s/v)*1000”
The target equation is t=(s/v). In this problem, the distance s=1000 km
= 1,000,000 m.&nbsp; The student may be assuming s is in km and thus be
putting in the 1000 as a conversion factor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andes assumes s
is in meters.
<ul>
<li>
IH wants the student to delay substituting numbers in until the problem
is solved with variables only.</li>

<li>
RO says, “your equation looks like t=(s/v)*s” then checks dimensionality.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Are you sure you want to multiply by 1000 on the right side
of the equation?”</li>
</ul>
If the bug were not implemented, then Andes would give next-step help.&nbsp;
This isn't great.&nbsp; It&nbsp; would ask for the sought (duration) and
the method (speed-distance-duration) then ask the student to write the
equation without substitutions.&nbsp; That should prompt the student to
write t=s/v or v=s/v, which would be correct.&nbsp; If the student reenters
t=(s/v)*1000, then Andes will again mark it red.&nbsp; If the student ask's
what's wrong, Andes will call next-step help, which will give the teaching
hint for s-d-d.&nbsp; If the student asks for help again, the bottom out
hint will tell the student to write v=s/t.&nbsp; The student would probably
never realize what was wrong.
