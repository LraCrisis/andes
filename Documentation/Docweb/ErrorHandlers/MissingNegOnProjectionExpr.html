<h2>
Missing negation in a projection expression</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/26/01)</center>

<p>If the student entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that contains (mag ?vector)</li>

<li>
and (= (compo ?vector ?axis) (* (mag ?vector)(?trig ?arg))) is a correct
equation</li>

<li>
and replacing (mag ?vector) with (- (mag ?vector)) in the student's equation
makes it correct,</li>
</ul>
then the hint sequence is
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "Check your projection of ~a onto ~a." ?vector ?axis)</li>

<li>
(hint string (point) "To avoid errors, you should apply the procedure for
calculating projections that involves taking the difference between the
vector’s rotation and the axis’ rotation.")</li>

<li>
if ?axis is an x-axix, then</li>

<ul>
<li>
(hint string (teach) "In order to avoid errors when projecting a vector
onto the x axis, it is best to use a simple formula:&nbsp; Q_x = Q*cos(Q_orientation
- Coordinate_system_orientation) where Q_x is the component of quantity
Q along the x-axis, Q is the magnitude of the quantity, Q_orientation is
the direction of Q with respect to the picture (i.e., the number that appears
in the Andes form that you used to defined the vector), and Coordinate-system_orientation
is the rotation of the coordinate system.&nbsp; In this case, your equation
would be ~a." (= (compo ?vector ?axis) (* (mag ?vector) (?trig ?arg))))</li>

<li>
&lt;same thing with y instead of x and sin instead of cosine></li>
</ul>

In the problem where the model airplane is hanging from two strings, the
student define variables, draws a correct FBD, enters several projection
equations and enters “Ft1_x = Ft1*sin45.”&nbsp; The right side should have
a minus sign.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes that there is a sign error and addresses the sign of the forces.</li>

<li>
RO also notes sign error and also addresses the sign of the forces, specifically
sign of “Ft1_x”.</li>

<li>
Andes1 says to check signs.</li>

<li>
KVL:&nbsp; The student has not entered NFL in component form yet, so Ande's'
first response should be to treat this as an error where the closest matching
equation is premature.&nbsp; However, entering the component equation will
probably not prevent the sign error nor help the student detect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, Andes should direct the student to fill in the skipped step then
ask about this equation again.&nbsp; If they do, then Andes should hint
about how to apply the projection procedure.</li>
</ul>
The bug substitutes -Ft1 for Ft1, which makes the equation correct.&nbsp;
Indy analysis equations reveals that the correct equation is primitive,
namely,&nbsp; Ft1_x= -Ft1*sin45.&nbsp; SG analysis indicates that the compo
form of NSL needs to be done first, so Andes first hints "You skipped the
step of entering Newton's law in terms of component variables.&nbsp; Why
don't you enter that equation, then ask again about why this equation is
wrong.&nbsp; In general, its easier to remedy errors when no earlier steps
have been skipped." then teaches the compo equation, then gives a bottom
out hint for the compo equation.
<p>Suppose the student enters the compo equation and then asks again why
the Ft1_x=Ft1*sin45 equation is red.&nbsp; Andes looks up the interpretation
of the equation and finds {Ft1_x=-Ft1*sin45} again.&nbsp; Checking the
solution graph reveals that it is not premature, so the bug's hint sequence
is given.
