Wrong trig function</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/21/01)</center>

<p>These errors are detected by replacing one trig function by another.
<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that contains (?trig-student ?arg) where ?trig-student is a trig function</li>

<li>
and replacing ?trig-student with ?trig-correct makes the equation correct</li>
</ul>
then give the hint sequence
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "If you use the formula based on subtracting the rotation
of the axis from the rotation of the vector, then you will make fewer trigonometry
mistakes.")</li>

<li>
(hint string (point) “An easy way to project a vector onto the x-axis is
to first find the angle as you move counterclockwise from the horizontal
to the vector (call that q), then find the angle as you move counterclockwise
from horizontal to the axis (call that a),&nbsp; then put their difference
(q-a) inside a cosine.”)</li>

<h3>
krista Eq-USNA 3-18</h3>
In the problem where a lit firecracker is thrown into the air, the student
draws initial velocity, a vertical displacement, and axes with X upward.&nbsp;
The student then enters givens and “v_x=v*cos60” The target equation has
sin(60) instead of cos(60).
<ul>
<li>
IH notices a trigonometry error in the student’s work and focuses on definition
of trig. functions physically.</li>

<li>
RO also notices trig. error and uses similar method to assist student.</li>

<li>
Andes give the trig. substitution away</li>
</ul>
When Andes substitutes sin for cos, the equation becomes correct according
to color-by-numbers.&nbsp; Indy analysis indicates that the students equation
is primitive.&nbsp; The solution graph indicates that it is premature,
because the vertical kinematics equation has not been written.&nbsp; (This
is maybe not ideal, because the compo equation doesn't really have to be
written before the projection equations, but that is the way the KB reads
right now.)&nbsp; Andes gives the usual error message, but leaves the red
equation on the screen.
<p>Suppose the student enters the appropriate compo equation then asks
again what's wrong with this equation.&nbsp; Andes retrieves the interpretation,
notes that the primitive equation is no longer premature, and triggers
the bug's remediation.

<a NAME="dirtyB 07-28"></a>DirtyB Eq-USNA 07-28</h3>
In the problem where a lit firecracker is thrown into the air, the student
draws an initial velocity v, enters some equations, then enters “v=20*cos(60)”
The target equations are v_y=v*sin(60) or&nbsp; v_x=v*cos(60) where v=20.
The first is on a solution path, but the v_x equation is on a dead-path
even though it matches most closely.
<ul>
<li>
IH refreshes student about sin/cos properties and ask, “were you trying
to express the magnitude of the initial velocity or one of its components?”</li>

<li>
RO notices mix up between v_x &amp; v and notes that “v=20” and questions
student as to which variable was intended.</li>

<li>
Andes says, “Do you want to use ‘v_x’ rather than ‘v’?”</li>

<li>
KVL:</li>
</ul>
The solution graph does not contain v_x=v*cos(60), because it is not needed
for solving the problem.&nbsp; Thus, Andes cannot find that interpretation
of the student's equation.&nbsp; It does find that substituting v_y for
v and sin for cos yields v_y=20*sin(60), which is correct according to
color-by-numbers.&nbsp; Indy analysis indicates that it is a compound of
v_y=v*sin(60) and v=20.&nbsp; SG analysis indicates that the student has
substituted in a given value prematurely.&nbsp; Andes gives the appropriate
prematurity message and encourages the student to ask for help again after
fixing the equation.
<p>Suppose the student changes the equation to v=v*cos(60).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This probably looks funny to the student, so when they get red, they change
it to v_y=v*cos(60).&nbsp; Still red!&nbsp; They ask what is wrong.&nbsp;
Andes substitutes sine for cosine, and gets a correct, primitive equation
that is not premature, and gives the usual hint sequence for projection.

<a NAME="022496 2-20-21"></a>022496 Eq-USNA 2-20-21</h3>
In the problem where the race car is going around an inclined track, the
student defines variables, draws a FBD without the acceleration (the axes
are not aligned with the sought variable, but the solution is more efficient
this way), enters givens, then enters "mcar * G = cos(70)*mcar*(v^2)/r"
The closest matching correct equation is mcar*G*cos(70)= sin(70)*mcar*(v^2)/r,
which is N2L applied to the x-axis with the definition of centripetal acceleration
substituted in for a.&nbsp; How the student got such an advanced equation
is a mystery.&nbsp; The student has left out cos(70) on the left side,
and has replaced sin(70) with cos(70) on the right.&nbsp; Alternatively,
the student could have intended tan(70) on the left instead of sin(70).
<ul>
<li>
IH incorrectly thinks the closest matching equation is mcar*G*cos(70)=
mcar*(v^2)/r, so she gives a refresher on the trig. identities.</li>

<li>
RO incorrectly thinks the closest matching equation is mcar*G*cos(70)=
mcar*(v^2)/r, then coaches student to project weight onto the x-axis, then
apply N2L along the x-axis.</li>

<li>
Andes suggests student uses tan(70) instead of cos(70).</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should say, “You’ve probably made a careless error by skipping
too many steps.&nbsp; I assume you are applying N2L to the car along a
20 degree axis.&nbsp; If so, you should finish drawing vectors.”&nbsp;
The next hint is to draw the acceleration, followed by a teaching hint
on circular acceleration, followed by a bottom-out hint.</li>
</ul>
Andes can diagnosis this equation by substituting tan for cos.&nbsp; The
resulting equation is correct but quite compound and vastly premature.
