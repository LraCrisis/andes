Axis rotation causes xy substitution</h2></center>

<p>If the student's entry is an equation
<ul>
<li>
that contains (compo ?vector ?axis)</li>

<li>
and the student has rotated axes by 90, 180 or 270 degrees</li>

<li>
and substituting (compo ?vector ?other-axis)&nbsp; makes the equation correct</li>
</ul>
then
<ul>
<li>
(hint string (point) "Your axes are not in the standard orientation.&nbsp;
Is &lt;student's variable> what you want here?" )</li>

<li>
(hint string (bottom-out) "Because your axes are rotated, you need to use
&lt;correct variable> instead of &lt;student variable>."</li>

If a 100 kg person slides down a rope that will hold only 500N, what is
his minimum acceleration? The student defined variables, drew a body and
axes with +X straight up, and entered “F_y = 500” where F is the friction
force.&nbsp; The closest matching equation is F_x=500.
<ul>
<li>
IH notes “F_x = 500 N” as student’s intended equation and points out definition
of axes to student.</li>

<li>
RO notes “F_y = 0N” as student’s intended equation and also points out
definition of axes to student.</li>

<li>
Andes gives no equation and explains that F_y is an unknown value for Andes
and thus will be marked incorrect anywhere.</li>

<li>
KVL: Andes should first ask the student to draw forces, then say, “F_y
is the y-component of the friction force.&nbsp; Is that really what you
want here?”</li>
</ul>
Andes substitutes all forces for F_y and finds that using F_x makes the
equation correct.&nbsp; Indy analysis finds that it is a cmpound of F_x=F
and F=500 (this assumes that the problem statement is interpreted to make
the friction force be 500; that's the whole trick with this problem, and
we don't have an easy way to represent it in the KB).&nbsp; SG analysis
finds that the student needs to draw forces first, so Andes says to do
that.
<p>Suppose the student draws the fbd then asks again why F_y=500 is wrong.&nbsp;
Andes retrieves the interpretation, and SG analysis says that it has a
given value substituted into it prematurely, so Andes says that.
<p>Suppose the student changes the equation to F_y=F and&nbsp; again asks
what's wrong.&nbsp; Andes retrieves the interpretation, and now SG analysis
is happy.&nbsp; Now Andes must decide whether to tutor the student on the
projection equation for the horizontal (y) axis (not this error handler),
or whether the student slipped and used the wrong variable (this error
handler).&nbsp; Even without knowing anything about the student, it is
clear to the human tutors that the student slipped.&nbsp; This is because
the student used a non-standard rotation for the axes and switching the
variable names makes the equation right.
