Pseudo errors: Cases that Andes1 marked incorrect which Andes2 should mark

AMM at 5-47</h3>
A car can go from rest to 22.4 m/s in 8.20 seconds.&nbsp; Assuming the
acceleration is constant, how long will it take to speed up from 13.4 m/s
to 18.9 m/s?&nbsp; The student has solved the problem correctly and efficiently,
and entered the answer correctly.&nbsp; The student has also drawn the
displacement of the car from T0 to T1, and Andes 1 marks it wrong.&nbsp;
Andes2 should mark it correct, because it is part of a less efficient solution.

A block is launched from a spring at T0, flies off the spring at T1 and
reaches the apex of its trajectory at T2.&nbsp; The sought quantity is
the height, but the student's first action is to draw the displacement
of the block from T0 to T2.&nbsp; The student should have defined a variable
for the height of the block at T2 instead.&nbsp; This is a rather arbitrary
convention of Andes that should just be told to the student (see <a href="../DesignDiscussion/SpatialMeasures.html">discussion</a>).
<p>The error handler is: The student defines a displacement of ?body from
?t0 to ?t1, and that quantity is not used in the problem, but the height
of ?body at time ?t1 is used, then point/teach/state that for problems
where gravitational potential energy is used, Andes expresses it in terms
of a height quantity rather than a displacement.
<p>This hint sequence gives away the fact that the relevant PSM is conservation
of energy.&nbsp; We could do better, but if we change the workbench as
per the discussion, then this error can't occur anymore.

A bullet leaves the gun at T0, hits the gong&nbsp; at T1 and the sound
reaches the shooter at T2.&nbsp; The student defines a variable for the
magnitude of the displacement of the sound from T1 to T2.&nbsp; This is
almost correct, but Andes wants the student to define a distance instead
of a displacement.&nbsp; Same <a href="../DesignDiscussion/SpatialMeasures.html">discussion</a>
as before: maybe one spatial measurement tool should be used instead of
several.&nbsp; Otherwise, we need to trap this error and give a hint sequence
that teaches when to use which tool.
<h3>
Ingpole at 8-35</h3>
If a roller coaster tops a 20 m hill moving at a speed of 3 m/s, then what
is its speed at the bottom of the hill?&nbsp; The student has defined a
variable for the height of the hill when it should be the height of the
coaster.
<p>This is a non-obvious convention of Andes: Even when the problem specifies
a spatial measurement for a hill, inclined plane or some other object that
is not a body, the principles use spatial measures that involve only the
bodies.&nbsp; Although we could ask authors not to include non-body objects
in the menus for spatial measures, that would be an easy request to overlook.&nbsp;
We could also teach the convention to students, but they have enough to
learn without that.&nbsp; Thus, it is better to catch this "error" and
handle it by mapping the student's quantity into the equivalent correct
quantity.&nbsp; To do that, we need some new propositions in the problem
representation, namely, same-position(object1, time1, object2, time2).&nbsp;
These propositions are used only by this error handler.
<p>The error handler is: "If the student has drawn a spatial measure from
?body1 at ?time1 to ?body2 at ?time2, and that spatial measure is not used
in the solution, but there is a spatial measure in the solution from ?bodyA
at ?timeA to ?bodyB at ?timeB, and
<br><tt>(or (and (equal ?body1 ?bodyA)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equal ?time1
?timeA))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (and (same-position ?body1, ?time-includes1,
?bodyA, time-includesA)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tinside ?time1
?time-includes1)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tinside ?timeA
?time-includesA)))</tt>
<br><tt>and</tt>
<br><tt>(or (and (equal ?body2 ?bodyB)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equal ?time2
?timeB))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (and (same-position ?body2, ?time-includes2,
?bodyB, time-includesB)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tinside ?time2
?time-includes2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tinside ?timeB
?time-includesB)),</tt>
<br>then put an entry in the symbol table that maps the student's spatial
measure onto the solution's spatial measure."

A block is launched from a spring at T0, flies off the spring at T1 and
reaches the apex of its trajectory at T2.&nbsp; The student defines the
potential energy of the spring at T2, but it should be the potential energy
of the block.&nbsp; This is a peculiar convention of Andes.&nbsp; Whereas
physicists normally talk about the energy of a system, which would include
both the block and the spring in this case, Andes wants students to put
only the block in the "of" slot of the dialog box.&nbsp; As is clear from
<p>Error handler: If the student has entered a potential energy of ?object,
and there is an potential ?energy on ?body due to ?object, then put an
entry in the symbol table that maps the student's entry on to the correct
op application.
