<h2>Workbench Command Strings: General</h2>

<p>The workbench exposes a command string interface to other
programs. The ANDES log player uses this interface when it
replays the session log: an ANDES log file contains a sequence of
commands sufficient to recreate all the student actions on the
interface. The Workbench command string interface also supplies
the means by which the help system can send commands to display
help messages on the workbench interface. </p>

<p>A workbench command string consists of the command identifier
followed by a space followed by a command-specific list of
arguments. In most cases the arguments are alphanumeric tokens
delimited by white space. However, some commands like
&#147;show-hint&#148; make use of &#147;trailing string&#148;
arguments, in which everything from the start of the argument
position to the end of the string is taken as the argument.
Trailing string arguments can therefore include spaces. </p>

<p>The Workbench commands that are primarily intended for use by
the help system are: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>show-hint </tt><a
    href="HintDescriptorReturnValue.html"><tt>&lt;hint
    descriptor&gt;</tt></a><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show a
    hint in the tutor msg pane</tt> <br>
    <tt>show-lesson lesson-file-name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show an
    ANDES mini-lesson</tt> <br>
    <tt>open-browser
    URL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    open lesson viewer on any URL</tt> <br>
    <tt>close-browser&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    close lesson viewer if open</tt> <br>
    <tt>msg &lt;message
    text&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    show text in a dialog box</tt> <br>
    <tt>training-card
    card-id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    pop up a training card</tt> <br>
    <tt>show-demo
    demo-file-name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; play
    a log file as a demo script</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These commands are most often sent &quot;piggy-backed&quot;
onto the return value of a help system API call. </p>

<p>It is also possible for the help system to send a command to
the workbench asynchronously at any time. However, this facility
is deprecated for the purpose of giving help since it involves
unsolicited interruptions of the user&#146;s work that could be
annoying to the student. <br>
