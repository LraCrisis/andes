<h2>
The Hint data structure</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/16/01)</center>

<p>In Andes 2, physics knowledge is represented by operators.&nbsp; Each
operator has a Hints slot, which contains an ordered list of hints, where
a hint is an instance of the following structure
<p>(defstruct hint
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; format
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; args)
<p>The format of the&nbsp; hint is either STRING, MINILESSON or KCD.&nbsp;
The functions field contains a set of atoms:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
teach -- this hint attempts to teach the relevant operator or concept.
For instance, a string hint that teaches the normal force direction would
be "The direction of the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface
that exerts it.&nbsp; This is because ...."</li>

<li>
point -- a "pointing" hint in the style of those identified by Hume et
al.&nbsp; It gives some information away in the hopes that this will trigger
the student to recall or reconstruct the rest.&nbsp; For instance, "Think
about the direction of the normal force."</li>

<li>
goal -- Prompts the students by mentioning the goal of this operator.,
e.g., "You need to draw a force due to the surface."</li>

<li>
bottom-out -- Tells the student exactly what to do.</li>
</ul>
We can add more functions later.&nbsp; For instance, Recap might be a hint
that is presented after a problem is over, and Remind could be a teaching
hint that is presented only if the student has already seen a teaching
hint on this topic.&nbsp; The&nbsp; functions field is a *set* of functions
because the same hint might be useful for multiple purposes.&nbsp; For
instance, a Remind hint and a Recap hint might be the same.
<p>The string field is the string to be printed if this is a STRING hint.
If the hint is a MINILESSON or KCD hint, then the string field contains
an string that names the file containing the minilesson--this file is loaded
by the workbench inorder to play the minilesson.&nbsp; If the hint is a
KCD hint, then the string is names the KCD.&nbsp; This could be a file
name or an index into some in-core list of KCDs.
<p>The args field represents the arguments of the hint.&nbsp; The form
of the arguments depends on whether the hint is in the Hints slot of an
operator, or whether it is being passed around in the dialog system.&nbsp;
When it is in the Hints slot of an operator, the args slot contains set
of FOL terms that include variables.&nbsp; For instance, the following
is a string hint as it appears in the Hints field of an operator:
<p>(string (point) "Think about the forces acting on ~a ~a." (?body ?time))
<p>The terms ?body and ?time are not bound yet, but will be bound when
the operator is applied.&nbsp; When dialog system wants to find out what
hints are available for a particular path-node in the PSM graph, it calls
a function that not only returns the hints, but replaces the variables
in the args field with their bindings.&nbsp; Thus, the same hint when the
dialog system first gets ahold of it would be
<p>(string (point) "Think about the forces acting on ~a ~a." (Car1 (during
1 2)))
<p>When the hint is eventually generated, these terms are converted into
text, and the text replaces the ~a codes in the string.&nbsp; Thus, the
eventual hint shown by the workbench would be "Think about the forces acting
on the car during time 1 to time 2."
<p>Currently, KCDs&nbsp; do not accept arguments.&nbsp; Minilessons may,
but I'm not sure because I don't know how well the old template-based minilessons
that Anders implemented would fit in our new system.&nbsp; Someone needs
to resurrect that code.
