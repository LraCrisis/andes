<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>This document describes the API by which the ANDES workbench process communicates with the ANDES help system process. </P>
<P>For most interactions, the workbench effectively does a remote procedure call (RPC) to call a function implemented in the help system process, waits, and receives a string as a return value from the function call.  </P>
<P>In earlier released versions of ANDES, the ability to achieve the effect of a remote procedure call was implemented by sending command strings using the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) message protocol. For that reason, these RPC exchanges are referred to as "DDE" operations in the log files and in several places in the documentation.</P>
<P>However, in recent experimental versions and future released versions, the DDE protocol is no longer used. Rather, the RPC layer is now implemented using a TCP connection between the processes. We have defined a very simple protocol for packaging up command strings and string-valued results into messages to be written to and read from a TCP byte stream, the <A HREF="CommandStringProtocol.html">Andes Command String Protocol</A>.</P>
<P>The command string protocol layer should be transparent to the bulk of the workbench and help system code. With this layer in place, the main part of the code can be written on the assumption that the workbench can somehow send a Lisp functional S-expression to the help system which can be read and evaluated by the lisp interpreter,  and can get a string-valued result back if needed.  The functions called in this way by the workbench comprise the help system API.</P>
