<h1>Physics Variables in the Algebra System
</h1>

This page discusses the internal representation of physical variables in the
algebra system.
<p>
The class <TT>physvar</TT> is instantiated for each `canonical' variable,
that is, those defined by the SGG, and in terms of which the `canonical'
equations are written. A list of these objects is kept in <tt>canonvars</tt>.
The equations do not actually contain these variables as objects, but instead
have <tt>physvarptr</TT>s which point to them.
<P>
The class is defined in <TT>expr.h</TT>, but its member functions have been
moved to <tt>physvar.cpp</tt>.
<P>
The member data fields are:
<UL><LI><TT>double value</TT> The numerical value of this variable, expressed
     in terms of the units given in prefUnit (not necessarily UI). This is
     almost not used, as in the solver, as soon as the value of a variable is
     known, the value is substituted in place of the variable in all the
     equations and, after writing out the value, the variable is discarded.
     But it may be used in future interactions with the help system.
    <LI><TT>string prefUnit</TT> A string representing the units in which
	 this variable is to be expressed. These may be nonstandard units.
	 Right now (4/01) the only nonstandard units used are degrees, so
	 a right angle may be represented with value = <TT>90</TT>,
	 prefUnit = <TT>deg</TT>, or as value = <TT>1.57079632679490</TT>,
	 prefUnif = <TT>rad</TT>.
    <LI><TT>string clipsname</TT> The canonical name of the variable. [The
	 name has obsolete historical significance.]
    <LI><TT>string shortname</TT> Not used. Would be nice, though, if we
	 really need to look at equation files, especially if these were in
	 MathML.
    <LI><TT>string studname</TT> Not currently used, as the help system does
	 not currently inform the algebra system what name the student has
	 given to the variable in question. If we change our minds, we need
	 to introduce another bit, because sometimes the student variable
	 refers to <i>minus</i> the canonical variable.
    <LI><TT>vartype type</TT> Not used. Was intended to have things like
	 mass, force, <i>etc</i>. An enum is defined in 
	 <TT>expr.h</TT>, but it hasn't been used.
    <LI><TT>dimens MKS</TT> The physical dimensions of this quantity.
	 Here are the specifications for <A HREF=dimens.html>class dimens</a>,
	 which contains the exponents of the basic units needed for this
	 quantity.
    <LI><TT>bool isnonneg</TT> If the quantity cannot be negative, this is
	 true. False may mean unknown, not that the quantity <b>is</b>
	 negative.
    <LI><TT>bool isnonzero</TT> If the quantity cannot be zero, this is
	 true. False may mean unknown, not that the quantity <b>is</b> zero.
	 Mass variables are taken nonzero by a convention that we will not
	 assign mass variables for massless knots, etc, which
	 are <i>a priori</i> known to be massless
    <LI><TT>bool isparam</TT> Parameters are variables which cannot be solved
	 for, but which enter in the expressions for some relevant quantities,
	 although not necessarily in the answer. The solver, checker, and
	 independence checker assigns these arbitrary positive values, for
	 their own purposes. 
    <LI><TT>bool isused</TT> If a variable is declared but never used in any
	 canonical equation, it is marked unused and ignored. But these
	 variables must be removed before proceeding to the checker or
	 independence system.
</UL>	 
Member functions of the class physvar:
<UL>
    <LI><TT>physvar()</TT> No point, really, creating one without a name
    <LI><TT>physvar(string clipsname)</TT> The standard constructor
    <LI><TT>~physvar()</TT> Destructor (usually I used delete instead)
    <LI><TT>void putclipsname(string)</TT> not used, as the fields are public
    <LI><TT>void putshortname(string)</TT> not used at all
    <LI><TT>void putvartype(vartype)</TT> not used at all
    <LI><TT>bool checkifknown()</TT> not used at all
    <LI><TT>double getlenghtd()</TT> it's easier to use member functions
	 of <A HREF=dimens.html><tt>dimens</tt></A>.
    <LI><TT>double getmassd()</TT>
    <LI><TT>double gettimed()</TT>
    <LI><TT>double getcharged()</TT>
    <LI><TT>double gettempd()</TT>
    <LI><TT>void putdimens(int,int,int,int,int)</TT> not used, but should be.
    <LI><TT>void putdimens(double,double,double,double,double)</TT>
    <LI><TT>string getInfix()</TT> can also just access clipsname, which is
	 what would be printed. In fact, I can't find the definition!
    <LI><TT>void pretty()</TT> In fact, I can't find the definition!
    <LI><TT>void dbgprint()</TT> In fact, I can't find the definition!
</UL>
