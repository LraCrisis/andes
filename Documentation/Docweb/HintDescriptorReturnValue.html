<h2>Hint Descriptor return value</h2>

<p>Help System API functions that respond to help requests
including &#147;what&#146;s wrong&#148; requests should return
Hint Descriptors. Hint Descriptors are also used as arguments to
the show-hint command that can be piggy-backed on an <a
href="EntryStatusReturnValue.html">entry status return value</a>
to show unsolicited help messages. However, because help requests
themselves are made for the express purpose of soliciting hints,
they don&#146;t have to piggy-back a show-hint command string on
their return value, but rather simply return the hint descriptor
itself. The context of the call ensures this will be interpreted
as a hint descriptor to be shown as by show-hint. </p>

<p>A hint descriptor consists of up to two parts: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>HintSpec -&gt; &lt;message body&gt;[~flags] <br>
    Flags -&gt; flag | flags flag <br>
    flag -&gt; w | e | h | ? | &lt;empty&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first part is the hint message text. The second part is a
string of single-character flags coding the set of possible
continuations (&quot;followups&quot;) to be offered to the
student. These flags are as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>&nbsp;h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how do I do
    that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (hint-next-substep)</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explain
    further&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (explain)</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    why&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (why)</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;free text
    response&gt;&nbsp; (get-dialog-response str)</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
The rightmost column above indicates the <a href="api.html">help
system API</a> that will be called if that followup is selected.
Get-dialog-response has only been used in Atlas which uses
natural language text, but may be used in the future with
Andes.&nbsp; We expect that this facility will have to be
extended to meet the specifications for the Andes2 help system,
for example, to code menu choices. </p>

<p>When the student issues a help request, the workbench goes
into a special <em>dialog mode</em>, in which further problem
solving actions are disabled while the tutor interacts with the
student. Any hint with followups specified continues this dialog
mode. If no possible student followups are provided, then the
message must be a <em>terminal hint</em> in the current sequence.
Receipt of a terminal hint signals the workbench to end the
dialog mode, or to enable a means for the student to dismiss it,
such as clicking an &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Hide&quot; button in
the window.</p>

<h3>Hypertext in hint messages</h3>

<p>There is a rudimentary hypertext facility that can be used in
hint messages. A hyperlink to a popup definition may be embedded
in a hint message by using the following form: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>{\d link-text}{\v glossary-id}</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an RTF-like notation that tags the link-text as a
definition. The \v tag in RTF means hidden text; in this case,
further link information is appended in invisible text next to
the definition. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The only thing that will be visible will be the link text in
hyperlink format. If the student clicks the link text, the
workbench will look up the definition under link-id in the Andes
glossary and display it in a popup window. An exmple hint-spec
including a hyperlink is: </p>

<p>Try using conservation of {\d energy}{\v energy} to find the
magnitude of the {\d instantaneous velocity}{\v inst-velocity} of
the car at {\d time}{\v time} 'T1'.~wh </p>

<p>In Andes1 the glossary is found in the Andes installation
directory in Pdata/glossary.txt. The help system uses a function
to run through every hint string it generates and change certain
keywords into hyperlinks. </p>

<p>For extensibility, we also allow the following form of
hyperlinks: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>{\h link-text}{\v helpsys-function-name}</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, clicking on the link will trigger a call back to
the help system function of the given name, without any
parameters. The call will be expected to return a hint string
like any other help request. However, this facility is not
currently used in Andes 1. </p>

<p>Greek letters may be coded in hint text is coded by the
two-character sequence dollar-sign char. This will display the
corresponding char using the Symbol font. For example, $a will
display as a Greek alpha.<br>
