Entry propositions</h2></center>

<center>(as of 4/27/01)</center>

<p>The following lists the "entry propositions" in the kb, those propositions
asserted into working memory that should represent the effect of a student
interface action, and so correspond to entry submissions reported by the
workbench to the help system.
<p>In some cases the form of the entry proposition is modified from the
original KB form asserted in working memory by deleting unneeded arguments.
The translation from the entry proposition form used by the problem solver
at solution generation time to the form needed by the help system at tutoring
time is defined in the table in KB/ontology.cl. Here we give the run-time
help system form, with notes where that results from a translation of an
original KB form.
<h3>
Drawn Bodies:</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (body ?body ?time)
<p>?body is either an atom or (compound &lt;atom> &lt;atom> ...).
<br>?time is either a positive integer or (during &lt;pos integer> &lt;pos
integer>).
<h3>
Drawn Vectors:</h3>
(vector ?quantity ?direction)
<br>&nbsp; e.g.
<br>(vector&nbsp; (at (accel block) 1) zero)
<br>(vector&nbsp; (at (force block plane normal) 2) (dnum 0 deg))
<br>(vector (at (net-force block) (during 1 2)) (dnum 37 deg))
<br>(vector (at (ang-velocity rod) (during 1 2)) into)
<blockquote>
<li>
?quantity is any vector quantity expression, see kb/ontology.cl for a list
of these with indications of their arguments</li>

<li>
?direction is usually a dnum for vectors in the x-y plane, but may also
be one of the following special atoms:</li>

<blockquote>
<li>
'zero&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for zero length vectors</li>

<li>
'unknown&nbsp;&nbsp; for vectors of "unknown" direction at the time of
drawing that lie in the xy plane</li>

<li>
'into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
z-axis into the plane of the screen</li>

<li>
'out-of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; z-axis out of the plane
of the screen</li>

<li>
'z-unknown&nbsp; unspecified but known to lie along the z-axis.</li>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
To match entries from the <a href="api.html">workbench API</a> to these
forms may require massaging the parameters sent by the workbench to build
an expression of the form used in the kb. For example, the force type identifiers
are not exactly the same.
<p>Note: the original KB form has an additional parameter:
<br>(vector ?body ?quantity ?direction)
<h3>
Drawn Axes:</h3>
(draw-axes ?x-axis-direction)
<p>?x-axis-direction is as above but so far is always a known numerical
direction.
<p>The workbench axes-drawing tool always draws orthogonal x and y axis,
and the workbench reports the direction of the positive x axis only. The
workbench currently does not associate bodies or times with axes at all,
so always sends NIL in the body parameter of the <a href="AssertXAxis.html">assert-x-axis</a>
API. We expect that may be changed soon to include a body. If more than
one axis is drawn the workbench API currently reports different labels
for each, e.g. x, y, z on the first; x1, y1, z1 on the second.
<p>Note: the original KB form is (draw-axes ?body ?time ?x-axis-direction).
<h3>
Drawn revolution radius*</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (radius ?body ?time)
<h3>
Labelled Angles*:</h3>
In the case of&nbsp; the angle between two vectors
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (angle ?vec1 ?vec2)
<p>The ?vec1 and ?vec2 specify vector quantities at times, e.g
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (angle (at (displacement block) (during 1 2))
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(at (force block man applied) (during 1 2)))
<br>The workbench API call will identify the vectors by the student variable
names, however.
<p>The workbench angle labelling tool can be used to introduce a label
for the angle between vectors or for an angle between a vector and an axis
(of which the angle made with the positive x axis is usually the one of
interest). This labelling step need not correspond to any step in the solution
graph -- it is a stipulative step, so always correct; the help system needs
to know about it only because the labels can be used in equations. However,
the angle between vectors is explicitly introduced in the solution graph
when computing work and torque, so could be matched to a solution action.
<p>* Optional, the relevant quantities can also be defined as variables
without having to be drawn.
<h3>
Variable Definitions:</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (define-var ?quantity)
<p>Again you have to look in kb/ontology.cl for a list of non-vector quantities
and may have to map from workbench quantity specs to the appropriate forms
in the kb to match student entries to kb propositions.
<h3>
<a NAME="equations"></a>Equations</h3>
(eqn ?equation)
<p>Note: the original KB eqn propositions have two forms which have additional
parameters:
<br>(eqn ?equation ?eqn-id)
<br>(given-eqn ?equation ?quantity) -- an equation for a given
<p>The API only sends the equation itself, and not the ?eqn-id or ?quantity
(third args of the above).&nbsp; Thus, when it builds an Entry proposition,
it can only build the ?equation argument.&nbsp; However, we want to use
an equality test in the SG module <a href="SolutionGraph.html#Search for match to entry">to
find the system entry that matches the student's entry</a>, so when the
SG module <a href="SolutionGraph.html#Load solution graph">builds the Entry
list as it loads the SG</a>, it must delete the third argument of these
propositions. It also maps them to a common form.
