Scenario of 2/28/01</h2></center>

<p><br>This scenario illustrates how axis choice interacts with equation
interpretation.
<p>Suppose the problem is the one we were discussing on friday, where there
is a 5 kg block sliding down a 37 degree frictionless inclined plane and
the acceleration of the block is sought.&nbsp; Suppose the student has
entered the body, the weight force, the normal force, the acceleration
and the equation W=m*g.&nbsp; The student has not drawn axes yet.&nbsp;
Suppose the student enters a=g*sin(theta) where theta is the 37 degree
angle of the inclined plane.
<p>The <a href="Manager.html">Manager</a> calls the <a href="EntryInterpreter.html">Entry
Interpreter</a>, which then calls the <a href="EquationParser.html">Equation
parser,</a> which parses the equation and replaces the student's variables
with system variables and gets something like (= a_b_t1_t1 (* g_earth (sin
theta_plane))).&nbsp; It sends this to the <a href="AlgebraManipulation.html">algebra
module</a>, which does color by numbers on it, and finds that it is correct.&nbsp;
The algebra module then searches its version of the Solution Index and
finds that there are two interpretations for the student's equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One for the rotated axis is
<br>[2] W_x1 + N_x1 = m*a_x1
<br>[4] W_x1 = w* sin(theta)
<br>[1] N_x1 = 0
<br>[1] a_x1 = 0
<p>The numbers in brackets are the cognitive loads.&nbsp; Although the
algebra module doesn't know anything about them, I'm writing them here
for easy reference later.&nbsp; Also, I'm using short variable names instead
of the long ones that the KB generates.&nbsp; The other interpretation
is:
<br>[2] W_x2 + N_x2 = m*a_x2
<br>[1] W_x2 = 0
<br>[4] N_x2 = N sin (theta)
<br>[4] a_x2 = a cos(theta)
<br>[2] W_y2 + N_y2 = m*a_y2
<br>[1] W_y2 = -W
<br>[4] N_y2 = N* cos(theta)
<br>[4] a_y2 = a*sin(theta)
<p>These two interpretations are returned by the algebra module to the
entry interpreter.&nbsp; The entry interpreter's version of the <a href="SolutionGraph.html#OpApp Index">OpApp
index</a>&nbsp; has cognitive loads for the equations, so it just adds
them up and determines that the interpretation for the rotated axis is
more probable.&nbsp; The Entry Interpreter sets this interpretation into
the student entry, and marks it correct.
<p>The Entry interpreter next calls the solution graph module to check
for missing prerequisites.&nbsp; The SG module finds that all four equations
have the same prequisite, namely drawing a rotated axis.&nbsp; Thus, it
returns a singleton set containig the rotated axis operator application.&nbsp;
The Entry Interpreter looks up the operator for the rotated axis step,
and gets some text intended to refer to the operator without giving it
away.&nbsp; The text is "drawing coordinate axes."&nbsp; It concatenates
the string, "Although your entry is correct, you've forgotten about drawing
coordinate axes."&nbsp;&nbsp; This message is passed to the Manager and
hence the workbench via a tutor turn struct along with a command to delete
the student's entry when the student has "OK'd" the message.
<p>Suppose the student now enters an unrotated axis.&nbsp; The solution
graph module looks this entry up in <a href="SolutionGraph.html#OpApp Index">OpAppIndex</a>.
It is flagged as Correct.&nbsp; That flag and a singleton interpretation
consisting of just the axis-drawing system entry are passed back to the
entry interpreter.
<p>The entry interpreter asks the solution graph module if this entry violate
prerequisites.&nbsp; The SG manager finds that this entry appears in two
PSM paths, namely, the application of Newton's second law to both the x-
and y-axes.&nbsp; However, in neither path are there any unentered prerequisite
entries, so the SG manager returns a null set.&nbsp; The entry interpreter
tells the Manager/workbench to make the student's entry green, then tells
the SG manager to update the solution graph.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SG manager
marks the unrotated axis entry as entered, then notes that it is incompatible
with another entry, namely the one for rotated axis.&nbsp; It marks the
solutions in <a href="SolutionGraph.html#Solution index">Solution Index</a>
that contain rotated axes as Incompatible, and tells the algebra manager
to do that as well.
<p>Suppose the student now enters "a=g*sin(37)"&nbsp; This equation has
a number without units, so the entry interpreter tells the workbench to
say, "The number 37 needs to have units." and turns the equation red.
<p>Suppose the student changes the equation to "a=g*sin(theta)."&nbsp;
The equation parser parses this successfully, and the entry interpreter
sends it to the algebra module.&nbsp; Color-by-numbers indicates that the
equation is correct, so correct compatible solutions in Solution List are
searched.&nbsp; Because incompatible solutions are ignored, the algebra
module finds only one interpretation, namely the longer one listed above.&nbsp;
This is returned to the entry interpreter.
<p>The entry interpreter asks the solution graph module if there are any
unentered prerequisites of the interpretation.&nbsp; It searches the SG
and finds that the student should have entered both the x- and y-axis component
equations, namely W_x+N_x=m*a_x and W_y+N_y=m*a_y.&nbsp; It returns both
these operator applications to the entry interpreter.&nbsp; The&nbsp; entry
interpreter decides to tell the student about both entries.&nbsp; It tells
the workbench to say, "Although your equation is correct, you need to do
the following steps first: (1) Write an equation for Newton's law applied
to the x-axis that expresses all vector components as subscripted variables,
and (2) write an equation for Newton's law applied to the y-axis that expresses
all vector components as subscripted variables." then delete the student's
equation.
<p>Suppose the student now enters "W_x+N_x=m*a_x."&nbsp; This sails right
through an gets colored green.
<p>Suppose the student next enters "N_x = N*sin(37 degrees)."&nbsp; This
is parsed successfully, and there is only one interpretation.&nbsp; There
are no unentered prerequisite steps.&nbsp; However, when the entry interpreter
calls the SG module to determine if the student has substituted numbers
prematurely, the SG manager finds that the interpretation contains the
equation "theta = 37 degrees" and does not contain all the equations necessary
to solve the problem.&nbsp; In fact, the only other equation in the interpretation
is "N_x = N*sin(theta)."&nbsp; Thus, the SG manager reports that the student
has substituted numbers prematurely.&nbsp; The entry interpreter has the
workbench tell the student, "That equation is correct, but you have replaced
theta with 37 degrees.&nbsp; Such substitutions should be delayed until
the end of the problem."&nbsp; When the student has okayed the message,
it deletes the student's equation.
<p>The students pulls out an Uzi and sprays the computer with 9 mm hollow
point bullets, so that's the end of this example.
