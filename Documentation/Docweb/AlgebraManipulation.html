Algebra manipulation</h2></center>

<center>(as of 3/20/01 by <b>Joel Shapiro</b>)</center>

<p>The algebra package is responsible for handling questions which involve
algebraic manipulation for the Andes system. At various times, it receives
information from the rest of the system. This includes
<ul>
<li>
The list of canonical variables (those used in the problem generation)
together with attributes of these variables</li>

<ul>
<li>
nonzero - variable can never be zero (e. g. mass of massive object)</li>

<li>
nonnegative - variable is intrinsically non-negative (e. g. magnitude of
a vector)</li>

<li>
parameter - variable's value cannot be determined from the information
given, but is not needed for the solution, or the solution may be expressed
in terms of this variable.</li>
</ul>
Here are <a href="Joel/varspec.html">details of the variable specification
API .</a>
<li>
The list of equations needed to solve the problem. This may be redundant,
and includes equations which specify numerical values for variables whose
values are given in the problem statement. Here are <a href="Joel/eqnspec.html">details
of the equation specification API .</a></li>

<li>
The equations entered by a student while she is solving the problem. These
are first translated by the help system (? or the workbench?) into the
canonical variables before presentation to the algebra package.</li>
</ul>
At various times, the algebra system is called upon to perform different
functions for the help system.
<ul>
<li>
At problem generation time, the first use of the algebra system is to solve
the canonical equations. The help system first sends the algebra system
the declaration of variables and the list of equations, and when this is
complete, the algebra system returns the solution, that is, a list of values
for each variable. Parameters are assigned random positive values, because
color-by-number equation checking and equation independence requires explicit
numerical solutions for all the variables.</li>

<li>
The solver does not check its solution, but there is a solution-checker
which does plug the numerical solution into each of the canonical equations
and report if there are descrepancies. This should be run once every time
the set of canonical equations is changed, as a check that everything is
all right.</li>

<li>
The bubble graph algorithm for finding solution paths requires walks through
the skeleton of equations and variables. For each variable sought for inclusion
into the bubble, it needs to add an equation which is independent of those
equations inside the bubble. The algebra system can be told to maintain
sets of independent equations (those within some bubble) and asked for
each candidate equation whether it is independent of those in a given set.
If so, it can be added. If not, the subset of equations within the set
from which it can be derived is available from the algebra system.</li>

<br>This is not complete ...</ul>

<h3>
Data structures</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="Solution list"></a>Solution List -- all known solutions to the
problem, where a solution is a set of independent equations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Check student equation"></a>Processing an equation entry (called
from the Entry Interpreter).</h3>
Check units.&nbsp; If the units don't check, then return Incorrect plus
a null set of interpretations.&nbsp; If units are okay, then plugs in numbers
for the variables (i.e., color by numbers).
<p>If the equation doesn't balance, then we searches the compatible buggy
solutions in Solution List.&nbsp; For each solution, we see if the students
equation is dependent on the solution's equations, and if so, it determines
the minimal set of equations in the solution required to derive the student's
equation.&nbsp; Such a minimal set is called an "interpretation" of the
student's equation.&nbsp; The algebra module returns to the help system
the flag Incorrect plus a possibly null set of all possible interpretations.
<p>On the other hand, if color-by-numbers indicates that the student's
equation is correct, then the algebra module determines which compatible
non-buggy solutions in Solution List are consistent with the equation.&nbsp;
For each such solution, it determines an interpretation for the student's
equation--the minimal set of equation entries required to derive the student's
equation.&nbsp; The algebra module returns the flag Correct plus a list
of these minimal sets of equation entries.&nbsp; If the student's entry
is unambiguous (the easy case), then the list will have just one member.&nbsp;
Otherwise, the equation has multiple interpretations.
