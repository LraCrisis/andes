Andes2 Overall Rchitecture.

The Andes2 architecture is built into a set of interrelated project nodes.
Each project node is designed to be used independently as necessary loaded by the user for its particular use.

Due to the interconnections in the codebase the system is designed to use the Andes2 modules system with its embedded provide/require calls to load the systems.  the architecture is:

Help: The help system with its associated subsystems.
KB: The knowledge base containing problem definitions, operators, etc.
Knowledge: The knowledge structures such as problems, operators, etc and their storage/access mechanisms.
Sgg: The solution and solution graph generator system. 

Algebra: Joe's algebra code which will be setup later.
