The "canonical" form of problem IDs (FOR2B, MIRROR1, etc) is all upper
case, because that is what standard Lisp will produce when reading and
writing the ID as a symbol.

The canonical name for the .prb file is then also
    UPPERCASEID.prb
because that is the way Lisp will generate them. The extension is still
lower case, though.

On the other hand, problem graphic files currently use *lower* case.
Thus, for example:
    for1.gif
Why? Lisp reads the graphic file name as a string, so preserves its
case. Since most of our existing graphics files were named this way, we
just kept to this convention when putting them on OLI.

(In the future, we could make do without any special convention for
graphic file name case. The only thing that should matter is that the
filename string specified in the .prb file matches the exact case of the
graphic file in the filesystem. However, because this was not
consistently done in the past, the current OLI workbench lowercases all
graphic filename strings it reads from the .prb files before fetching
them from OLI. If we made the case in .prb files consistent, we wouldn't
need any convention in future releases.)

[The following should not affect you for new problems. But if a .fbd
workbench problem file is used, the convention is also that it is
*lower* case:
    lowercaseid.fbd
Again, this is simply because that was the way the existing .fbd files
were named.]
